n is the number of hidden nodes
total storage capacity is n bits (should probably be greater than input string size)
total stored function data is n^2*(32*2) bits + input/output functions

Program handles ctrl-c to save model before exiting. Kill with other signal if you do not want to overwrite your model save file.

Model has 7 input bits (1 ascii character) and 7 output bits.
Computation model has 3 layers, input (x), output (y), and hidden (h); and 3 functions
    - x_to_h
    - h_to_h
    - h_to_y
    x_to_h and h_to_h are additivly combined to form the hidden state

All model state is stored in the CommentNetwork class.

Command line arguments, read them with -h
