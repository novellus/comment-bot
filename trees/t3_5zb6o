I was reading a historical novel about Genghis Khan, and the hunter / gather society of Genghis's people made their out swords from iron ore they mined themselves. Albeit they might have been taught this skill from the from more advanced, and agricultural society to the east, namely China, but that's a detail.\n\nHowever, crunch the numbers and I don't see how people even as determined as the Mongols could have launched rockets into space without agriculture.\n\nA space program represents, one of the most, if not the most, interdependent human activity known. It requires many people to work at least 40 hours/week either directly supporting the space program, or to provide the goods and services necessary to support the space program. And note we are talking about a space program that is capable of diverting an asteroid on 5 years notice, not the pitiful efforts we have today, that in the words of Bill Maher, lands a shopping cart on Mars every two years. Currently the US federal govertnment spends $16B/year on\nspace ( http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2006/nasa.html ). Let's be liberal and say that totally other countries and private industry, $100B/year is spend on space. Let's say $100B/year is enough to protect us from the risk of a killing asteroid. Let's say $100B\nrepresents the direct and indirect employment  ofm at $100K/year, one million workers, everyone from the rocket scientists, down to the guys who keep the coke machines stocked that the mission control workers buy from.\nLet's also say that everyone else earns $44K \n( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html#Econ  ) per person (adult and children), and we can convince everyone else to spend 1/10 of their income supporting the asteroid protection program. So $100B/ $4.4K = 22M wealthy workers. \n\nThe pre-agriculture human population (\n  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population#Population_figures\n\n) was under 10 million people. The hunter / gathers would never have pulled it off. Population did not grow to tens of millions and higher until we produced more food per square metre. Eating wild animals is energy inefficient. And eating wild plants did not produce enough energy either. It wasn't until agriculture bred wild plants that the edible foot per plant increased.\n\nAnd I think we are dreaming if we could convince 22M people (even if they were Mongols ruled by Khans) to give up 1/10th of their income for protecting from a risk that comes every 10M years or more. Indeed, we cannot even get 300M people in the USA to agree to fund enough money to pay for a comprehensive asteroid survey.\n\nOur only hope is to get the 6B people we have today, healthy, wealthy, and industrialized, and convince them to give up 1/10th of 1% of their income for asteroid protection.

During this same time, life expectancy has been said to have increased from 54 to 74 years.\n\nAt first glance it looks like people are living 20 years longer now than in the past. But this figure is misleading because it is just an average. It could mistakenly lead you to think that in 1920 most people lived to approximately 54 years of age and that now they live to approximately 74. This is not the case.\n\nConsider these facts. In 1920 an adult 60 years old could expect to live an average of 16 more years, to about 76. Today an adult 60 years old can expect to live 20 more years, to about 80. That is only a four-year difference that appears in the life expectancy figures.\n\nAdults are not living 20 years longer now than they did in 1920. In fact, adults today live little longer than they did in 1920, which is before the development of the powerful modern medications that are often credited with life extension. What has dramatically improved is our chance of surviving to 60.\"\n\nSo again it's erroneous to claim modern medicine extended our lifespan by decades. The biggest factor is clearly the infant mortality rates. It was certainly possible for someone a thousand years ago to live to the ripe old age of 80 without all the fancy technologies and pharmacological advancements that claim to have granted us an extended lifespan over our ancestors. Do more people get the chance today? Sure but there's also a lot more people on this planet which goes back to the concept of an agricultural society. So Diamond's article is merely asking: Has this form of society delivered to the masses its promise of a life of well fed leisure? Or is it a false promise perpetuated by the 1% of society who reap the benefit for themselves while we toil away at the expense of our health and happiness?

However, the QOL of certain people was significantly raised by agriculture. As the article described it, \"social parasites\" grew \"fat on food seized from others.\"\n\nNow, it is only because there existed this class of \"healthy, non-producing elite\" that much of our scientific and artistic advancements were made. Those very class divisions that Diamond lamented are one of the benefits of agriculture to humankind as a whole. \n\nFor example, classical Indian music developed completely inside the royal courts. Even until the early 20th century, it seemed ludicrous that they be performed to the public. A very similar situation existed in East Asia, Europe, and I'm sure pretty much everywhere else.\n\nDiamond refers loosely to \"great paintings and sculptures\" by ancient and modern-day hunter-gatherers. I don't know enough to say anything about that. I do know, though, that the human lifespan is so short that cutting down on leisure time is even to pick a few berries a day can seriously cut down on a person's potential achievements. \n\nCan you imagine a theoretical mathematician who picks their own food? Mathematicians say to me all the time that in order to do math, you have to be thinking about it and doing it all the time. There are so many stories about famous mathematicians who forsake family, sex, and society for their subject--as well as food. I feel that these aren't exaggerations, and I think that similar constraints hold for many other disciplines/arts as well.\n\nPeople like Aristotle, Da Vinci, and Mozart all survived off the patronage of the social elite (and thus were also \"social parasites\"). It is also interesting to note that so much of philosophy, math, etc have been developed by the same small group of people (Gauss, Descartes, Aristotle...). I think that this is partly due to those people being exceptional geniuses relative to everyone else, but I also think that it was because they had enough time (their entire lives) to educate themselves and think about stuff.\n\nAnother, semi-trivial point is that, with increased populations, there are more people innovating, increasing the speed of progress.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
