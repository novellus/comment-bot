I am biased because I bothered to learn Emacs, and somewhere along the line discovered how mind bogglingly powerful it is (and, conversely, how weak the \"modern\" IDEs are in so many ways).  I am biased because IDEs are powerful at changing huge tracts of code at the expense of being powerful at editing text.  I am biased because Emacs is a text editor written decades ago, and yet modern text editors don't have basic features it had when it was written.  I am biased because I watch people that have been coding for 5 times as long as I have, making twice as much, fumbling around their fancy IDEs with a mouse, thinking they are being productive.  I am biased because I was told by Tom Ball (a Netbeans developer) at JavaOne this year that I was in a \"dying breed\" because I wanted a kill ring in Netbeans so I could save consecutive kills and yank them at will.  At least they included keyboard macros in the latest release.\n\nAre you kidding?  Me having difficulty learning Emacs?  It was a pleasure and a breeze - it took several months and I got into functional programming as a side effect (ironic, eh?).  Emacs gets blasted for using shortcuts, and then Eclipse busts out S-M-q P to activate the package explorer and S-M-x T to run a test and people act like thats fine because they use the mouse for it anyway.\n\n&gt; I have never found an editor that took a significant amount of time compared to the the language I was trying to learn, except vi and emacs.\n\nReally?

Those are just the functions I know off the top of my head, and I use every one of them many times per hour.\n\nThere is a difference between using an editor and *knowing* an editor, and its not just about keyboard accelerators.  It's about understanding the power of the tool you have, understanding what it's good for, and understanding what it's awful for.  It has nothing to do with difficulty, it has to do with pride of workmanship and simple competence.\n\nEveryone has their own style of coding, and the approach that is advocated in this article is to have huge monolithic tools that cushion you from the harsh reality of the language you're using.  The side effect of this approach is that it demands heavy, industrial IDEs to do all that work, and that means less choice for programmers.  It means new languages don't have a chance to compete based on merit, instead they have to compete on tool availability (a sad truth in today's world).  We don't have language hackers anymore, people that like to pick up new languages and explore them.  Instead we have people trained on a single language in a single IDE, and they get scared if they have to use something on the command line.\n\nMicrosoft knows this, by the way, which is why they give away Windows and Visual Studio .NET for free to university students.
