Then came along the industrial age and modern healthcare, where infants tended to survive more, but health problems arose more frequently (ie, cancer, poor immune system, etc), so the people who lived tended to be sick more.

These days, I see a lot more people floating in and out of the hospital, especially a few years prior to their death, which itself is physically painful, and whereas if they lived in the 1800's and might have died early, these days they are kept alive indefinitely for several months, even years, thus raising the life expectancy, but not necessarily life quality.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "parent_id": "t1_c02bsap", "id": "c02bscr", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "author_flair_text": null, "name": "t1_c02bu49", "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5z9oy", "retrieved_on": 1427425137, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "body": "  There was a great article in National Geographic a year or so ago called The Secrets of Long Life.

Sometimes it's better to go one step back, in order to get two steps forward.  But nature has no way of doing this, because it cannot plan ahead. Given a certain set of choices, nature will always choose the one that has the immediately better payoff, never the one that is immediately worse but may end up better in the future.  This means nature will get stuck in certain situations where it still hasn't found the optimum solution, but all immediate choices are worse than staying where you are.  Humans, because we have consciousness and the ability for displaced thought, can get around this besting behavior and instead design for the ultimately optimum solution. (We can, though there's no guarantee we actually will!)\n\nSecond, nature doesn't give a hoot for personal comfort.  Nature only cares about survival.  Nature couldn't care less if you're happy, pain free, and fulfilled, as long as you breed successfully.  In other words, your personal goals may not be the same as nature's goals for you, and so nature's solution may not be the right one.\n\n", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "name": "t1_c02cbje", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5z9oy", "retrieved_on": 1427424910, "score_hidden": false, "body": "Oh I'm definitely not all over the \"organic\" bandwagon. I know that many companies claim to be \"organic\" because its often a good selling point. \n\nI guess my whole idea, not really being a strong argument, is that I think nature has the best design. And that design never needed pesticides, and what not. However, that design wasnt made to feed billions of people. So maybe its necessary?\n\nWhat the whiners should really do, and what I do, is grow your own food. No worries there. What scares me more than harmful chemicals and disease, is people who don't know how to take care of themselves and take the easy way of living for granted.

A \"chemical\" is any substance that takes part in a reaction at a molecular or atomic level.  We are made up of mass amounts of chemicals.  All the foods we eat, natural or synthetic, are make up of mass amounts of chemicals.\n\nSo, you need to revise your statement to say that \"mass amounts of HARMFUL chemicals can't be good for us\".  That's now a true statement. But it's true by definition, and so again not very meaningful.  The question isn't whether harmful chemicals are bad to ingest, but in fact which chemicals are bad and which aren't.  There are many naturally occurring chemicals that are harmful (cyanide, atropine, amatoxin, indole alkaloid, etc).  An organic farmer could use any of those deadly poisons to treat their plants and still be labeled organic.  (Theoretically. I'm not claiming any farmer does such a thing!)\n\nIt's always a good question to ask whether what we are eating is healthy for us.  But just jumping on the organic bandwagon doesn't help.  The exact same question remains, is what we are eating healthy for us?\n\n&gt; My grandmother has been running a farm for 50+ years, pesticide free. One thing I notice from her fruit and veggies than those of the store? Looks. I dont care is my fruit doesnt look \"perfect\".\n\nGood for her! Really.  There are all kinds of good reasons to grow your own food, not the least of which is the sense of satisfaction it brings.  It's also very hard to obtain the same fresh picked quality when you have to mass produce and distribute the product to far away markets.\n\n&gt; I love it when people know what debate is, as opposed to just arguing their point without hearing the other side.\n\nYes, agreed.  I don't mind the questions that the organic movement asks about industrial farming methods.  They're good questions to ask.  It's just the easy answers that the movement has provided to their own questions that fall short in my eyes.\n", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02c4jr", "id": "c02c52h", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 1, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5z9oy", "retrieved_on": 1427425000, "id": "c02c4jr", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02c4jr", "parent_id": "t1_c02bxtr", "body": "Ok, ill agree that diagnosing might be getting better.
