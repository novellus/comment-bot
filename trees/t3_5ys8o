Whoops! I mean he was \"reasonably arrested for crimes he may or may not have committed.\" \n\nWhat was his crime, so terrible that he should be beaten, arrested, and taken away from his family at 2am? He had been **accused** of *smoking* pot by our neighbor.  The police came in like he was the king of cocaine!!!   While the courts came through on this one it was pretty damn traumatizing to be stripped from my father without even getting to say goodbye (when I left my room an officer hit me in the face and told me to sit the fuck down).  \n\nI was then abducted by those heartless bastards at Child Protective Services and they tried very hard to coerce me into saying things that were lies.  \"Does Daddy ever go outside for more than 5 minutes?\" And then they did the fucking doll thing, I'm not kidding.  \"Tell me where he touches you.\"  I wasn't sure what he meant by this and asked and he said he just wanted to know how my dad touched me. I don't think I gave him the answer the sick bastard seemed to want though. He changed the question to \"does your dad ever kiss you\" which I said yes but then he's like \"we're done here!\" and I was escorted out.  So even after the charges were dropped for the so-called \"marijuana violation\" my dad had to fight in court to get me back.  All they had was that stupid kissing thing and they made it sound like some kind of daily rape.  Thankfully, somehow, the ruling was in his favor.\n\nSo yeah, I hope kids are growing up to fear the government.

It is something that can be automated.  This makes their entire business model untenable unless the government steps in and protects them with copyright laws.\n\nThis is the real problem here.  Recording artists are attempting to make money in a market that can't support them; the CD duplication market (or rather, the \"bit duplication market\").  Your market is very different to theirs; you aren't in the business of mass-manufacturing copies, you are selling one-off works.\n\nA lot of people think that recording artists make their money by creating music, and that's where a lot of misunderstandings and bad analogies arise.  Their business model is copying stuff, which is something any nine year-old child can do.\n\nThere are other business models they could use, and I don't think it's a coincidence that those business models are a lot more like your own.\n", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "name": "t1_c02ah2n", "parent_id": "t1_c02ag8r", "id": "c02ah2n", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "created_utc": "1193031986", "ups": 1, "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5ys8o", "retrieved_on": 1427425825, "score": 1, "body": "&gt; Musicians aren't different.
