If you can't afford $100, then please donate the most that you are able to.  If you can afford more than $100, then go for it.  The founders pledged their life, their fortunes, and their sacred honor for this country, so all of us need to hurt a little in order to keep the republic.\r\n\r\nThis is really quite easy to understand and it will be the straw that breaks the neoconservative back and sets our people FREE!  If you were fortunate enough to have watched the movie \"V for Vendetta\" then you know that November 5 is the most important day in the history of freedom.  If you have not seen the movie it would serve you to track it down and watch it.\r\n \r\nWe the people are taking our country back by doing a mass donation to the Ron Paul for President Campaign on November 5, 2007.  We are all going to donate $100 each on November 5, 2007.  It takes MONEY to play the game and your $100 donation on November 5 will make HISTORY.  Your name will go down in HISTORY as a Patriot who fought to save their country.\r\n \r\nRon Paul has over 50,000 active volunteers pounding the streets and donating money for the cause of freedom.  Do the math.  WE WILL TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK ON NOVEMBER 5, 2007.\r\n \r\nHere is where you need to go on NOVEMBER 5: https://www.RonPaul2008.com/Donate/\r\n", "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": "1192549296", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "politics", "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_5yf7o", "id": "c029hm9", "author_flair_css_class": null}
