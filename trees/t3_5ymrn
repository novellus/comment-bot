Some elaboration:\n\nThe lion's share of \"renewable\" energy is hydropower. Is hydropower going to increase its market share? No it will not, it is currently *decreasing* its market share. And will continue to do so in the future as more energy production is necessary and there continue to be no new rivers to dam.\n\nIs wind going to increase its market share? Yes it will, up to a point. But this increase in market share won't make up for the decrease in market share of hydropower since wind's current contribution to global generation is insignificant.\n\nIs solar power going to increase? Well like I said, its current contribution is zero.\n\nSo how the hell can it be \"a sure bet that renewable energy will grow in percentage sales of global energy sources\"? It isn't.
