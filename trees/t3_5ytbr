All year long they reviewed, then two weeks before the standardized test, they'd try to cram in whatever they should have learned all year.\r\n\r\nI used to just teach my daughter whatever math she needed to know for the year in a few afternoons over the summer. It isn't really much in the elementary years, borrowing and carrying one year, multiplication and division the next. You can teach the basic concept in a few hours using manipulatives, then do math problems out loud as a car game.\r\n\r\nThe downside is that she was bored all year in math, till I was able to get her into gifted classes. One teacher handled this pretty creatively by having D. act as a peer tutor to a child who was mainstreamed and had learning and behavior problems. \r\n\r\nThis was good for D, because the act  of \"elaboration\" helps fix concepts better, and she really enjoyed the connection. \r\n\r\nBy the end of the year the other girl was doing math on grade level, and seemed much happier. Kids for some reason seem to learn better from other kids than they do adults.\r\n\r\nAlthough D. benefited from the peer tutoring, I was also pretty glad when she got into a situation where she was being taught to her capabilities. \r\n\r\n*******\r\n\r\nJust as an aside, the core of moms who runs things at every school used to handpick their child's teacher every year. Technically, this wasn't allowed, but the principal would do it for them, of course. I just took luck of the draw, so only rarely was D. in the classroom the high-powered moms had favored.\r\n\r\n4 of 6 elementary years, by the end of the year, the moms were unhappy with the selection and wished they had been in the room with D's teacher. So sometimes what parents think they want isn't always what works out best.\r\n\r\nAnd sometimes you get screwed. I was able to basically force D's middle school to hire a gifted science teacher over the principal's objections (the school board sided with me), so in retaliation, he waited so late to start looking for a teacher, he ended up having to hire an English teacher. Then instead of putting them in a regular classroom with lab equipment, he gave them half of the in-school suspension room and 0 equipment. They weren't even allowed to borrow. I gave her the choice to switch back and she stuck it out, but she probably would have done better in the regular ed. room. But today (under a new principal) it's a thriving program they're justly proud of. \r\n", "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": "1193097255", "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 3, "parent_id": "t1_c02ao8q", "id": "c02aob1", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "name": "t1_c02ao8q", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 2, "link_id": "t3_5ytbr", "retrieved_on": 1427425749, "body": "Not what I meant, really.

I am a middle schooler.  Three out of four of my academic classes are for real high school credit (English I, Geometry, and Science Honors), and my Computer Apps elective is also for credit.  The only reason my History class is not high-school level is that my state does not offer it.\n\nI loathe homework.  I really do.  According, to my teachers, we should have ten minutes of homework each night... for each grade level.  Eighty minutes of homework... just hold us for class longer, dammit!\n\nI hate the viewpoint some of you are looking at this with.  People who state they \"recently graduated from X level of education\" agree, while those who don't haven't been in school for a long time, or even have kids.\n\nI have been in school, as I previously said, for eight years.  I have had eight years of being taught to the test (both standardized and upcoming in-class) and being drilled to no end.\n\nPractice, as they say, makes perfect. Bullshit.  I have &lt;b&gt;never&lt;/b&gt; understood a subject simply by doing homework.  By doing practice in class?  Yes, it helps:  I have the guidance of a teacher.\n\nThe author is right:  Homework is a significant source of stress.  Since school restarted, I have had to quit bike-riding (a carefree summer exercise program) to make sure I get everything done and fit in enough time to be with my family.\n\nI do concur with some of the statements made here:  Homework convices some parents that their kids are 'doing something'.  For me, this is untrue:  my parents know that I am getting an education every time a grade report is sent home via e-mail, or every time I rush home with an A test in tow.\n\nHomework is a liability.  So many people skip out on it entirely.\n\nHomework, and deadlines, do not teach us time-management, no matter how much my English teacher thinks so.  Please, if you disagree, back it up.  All it teaches is is procrastination and stress.\n\nEspecially in our culture, now is not the time to give more homework.  We need to give less.  This most definitely includes teachers who teach in the \"rigid schedule\" style -- read the book, do this worksheet, take this work home.\n\nHomework, as I've observed in both myself and my peers, is shit.  I don't know how many times I've tried to rush it done.  Many teachers, even if you demonstrated a knowledge and understanding of the topic, assign homework regardless.\n\nTo sum things up:  Homework sucks.  For some teachers, it's an easy way to catch up because you can't teach enough in class.  For others, it is actually used to teach what you should learn (e.g., vocabulary for homework, an activity my principal has told my class is \"busy work, to be done at home\").  For still others, it is a method to \"get done with this section, and move on to the next one.\"", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "name": "t1_c02aj67", "parent_id": "t3_5ytbr", "id": "c02aj67", "author_flair_css_class": null}
