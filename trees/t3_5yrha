Bhutto was notorious during her time for her corruption.  She is likely to bring a lot of corruption back.  Musharrah is pretty much a dictator but many did support him because of his crackdown on corruption.\n\nIt's a shitty situation made worse by the militants in Northern Pakistan.\n\nWhat I would like to see are articles that outline a positive future for Pakistan.  I don't particularly want to see the militants win nor do I think that appointing Bhutto to a powersharing agreement is anything more than a temporary solution.\n\nI would like to see Pakistan on a positive and clear path to progress.  Pakistan should be more cooperative with India, they should increase their trade.  I think that would help raise the standard of living for both of these countries.", "author": "sociohistorian", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c02aclw", "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": "t3_5yrha", "name": "t1_c02aclw", "author_flair_css_class": null}
