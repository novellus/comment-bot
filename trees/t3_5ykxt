Maybe I was just really stupid but before my entry into the internet the only candidates I knew about were those embraced by the MSM, righty talking heads like Rush and the such or those that had an interview on PBS or NPR that I happened to catch.  The rest of the guys were just window dressing we only heard about one line about, a senator from___ or a Governer from___ I think it depends on physical location.  When I lived in the midwest I had a great deal more information on politics and the history behind it than all but a hand full around me and they were always on the hard left or libertarian types.  All of this information though came from my own personal research into history and then into politics as living history.  When I moved to the west coast and when earlier I moved to the east coast at least in the major cities a great deal of my information was common knowledge and instead of me having to dig for facts I could find them at any local news stand.  Moving back to the midwest to get that kind of information I had to order multiple news magazines from around the world to have a clue what was real and what was state sponsored propaganda or US business propaganda that is until I got my grubby hands on the internet at which point I could begin to be more informed in real time.  Studies have shown those watching Fox know less than those watching MSM which know less than those reading the internet.  The reason why in my opinion is not because we read everything and believe it but because we read sites like Reddit and others that allow us to check the news sources we prefer for conflicts of interests and outright lies and misrepresentations therefore funneling out more and more propaganda from this and other countries all over the world as well as business and special interest group disinformation.  \n\nMost of the arguments had on these sites are between one side that believes what they have just shown discredits a source and the other side feeling it does not but this is a choice that is made not dictated to us by a talking head telling us what is and is not real.  For instance those who were getting their news from the government and the MSM thought Iraq had ties to terrorists and/or had weapons of mass destruction while those on the internet tended to disagree more often.  The main reason in my opinion was the news coming out of other nations, including the weapons inspectors, that I otherwise would not have had access to, that is what made me believe they were full of it at the time anyway.\nAs for the leftward tilt that is a matter of perspective.  When I first began commenting on news sites back in 2002-2003 I felt like a stranger in a strange land because I was in the minority.  Me and two other posters on some sites and me alone on others took the stances that are currently much more popular but I would like to point out that at that time popular opinion was against me and now popular opinion is against you and therefore makes it seem like a stacked deck but that is mostly due to disillusionment with Bush, his policies and the current state of the country.  \n\nIf you want to understand why it slants left look at the current polls, which does make a good argument that sites like this are representational of the country or world as a whole if they had access to all the information.  The population no longer trusts the media and those who believe it slants left is diminishing while those that think it slants right are growing.  In my opinion they are both wrong it slants hard left on social issues and right on foreign policy and economics.  Hence why both sides are convinced that it is slanted but no one can agree how.  While the right was more popular we on the left were told that the media was just giving the public what they wanted since the public slanted right but now that they slant left their has been no change hmm.  Still hard left on social issues and right or hard right depending on the station and time of day on economic and foriegn policy issues.\n\nAlso I believe in terrorisim, it is a tactic used by small groups in a guerilla war fare fashion.  I dont believe having a war against a tactic is either a good idea nor sane.  I also have a problem believing that our government is trying to fight a war on terror when they dont push forward peace between Israel and their neighbors nor do they go after Saudi Arabia, where most of the 911 hijackers came from and where they were brainwashed by state sponsored schools.  I also have difficulty backing Pakistan who's populace is intensely anti American and, if he is alive is where Osama may be hiding just because their military dictator is on our side when he can barely control his own country and its populace due to is illegitimacy.  I also know the only connection Iraq had to terrorism came after we invaded and sparked a Jihad in the region close enough for people to ride a bus to fight us.  Bush has lied to many times for anyone to believe anything he says anymore.  According to Alan Greenspan (who is far from a lefty)\"of course the Iraq war was about oil\" so why is it those of us that have been saying it since before it began are considered insane by those who believe in the war on terror as insignificant as there numbers are becoming?  According to government studies that are coming out now we have made terrorisim and AQ worse with our methods which again the left has been saying all along.  At this point to back the current situation is to divorce yourself from reality but lumping all those that disagree as on the left or peaceniks is a mistake as well.  Many  who disagree now are independents and libertarians who as the GOP continues its with us or against us stance are being further and further pushed into the Dems.  Meanwhile a great majority of those on the left are not peaceniks we are just against stupid wars or those started on false pretenses usually to make a profit.  In fact the only people left in the Bush pro Iraq camp tend to be those who think no president would ever do anything bad to any citizen on purpose to just make a profit which is pretty niave or those who just dont care who we bomb as long as they CAN profit off of it.  In summary I dont think this is an internet thing I think this is a demographic shift that has taken place and I think a lot of that shift is not because the left have won many converts as much as the right has isolated itself into a reality bubble that many are giggling at in fear of what they may do next.  PS I and I hope most people who read the web for news do not rely on Reddit for news but for opinion and to help check the sources of where we do get our news against others investigations.  Its also nice for obscure stories or interesting news blurbs I may have otherwise missed.  Also Ron Paul is the extreme right not the left its just that the Repubs have become very far left as much as the dems have become very far right, making them both useless in changing anything.", "author": "ponder22875", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "politics", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_c029z9x", "id": "c029zrh", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "politics", "name": "t1_c029z9x", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 0, "link_id": "t3_5ykxt", "retrieved_on": 1427426073, "body": " Nobody ever takes in to consideration that those who get their news from MSM may know exactly who Kucinich and Paul are and they may **completely disagree** with their positions.\n\nThe problem with the people on the internet - who consider themselves more informed than the general population - is that they fail to recognize how skewed the \"news\" they are getting is.  \n\nReddit is the prime example.
