True, but my Ph.D. is in comparative literature, not composition or linguistics, and I teach courses in the history of ideas rather than language as such. But I admire good writing and try to encourage it in my students.\n\nAnd here is what that obscure American reference, *Webster's Dictionary of English Usage*, has to say about the issue:\n\n&gt; **alternate, alternative**, *adjectives* The adjectives *alternate* and *alternative*, say many commentators, are often confused; they advise keeping them separate. The senses recommended are \"occurring or succeeding by turns\" for *alternate*, and \"offering or expressing a choice\" for *alternative*.\n\nIt is true that, these days, \"alternate\" is increasingly being used in place of \"alternative\". But that is because so many people like you don't know the difference any more. When usage changes because a preponderance of people are repeatedly committing errors out of ignorance, you have a choice: you can either conform to the trend, citing their ignorance as an excuse, or you can take a stand. I happen to be a person who thinks it is more useful to preserve the ability to make distinctions in language concisely, and this is an instance where there is a difference worth preserving.\n\nPerhaps you are a Lisp programmer who likes [Big Balls of Mud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_ball_of_mud).
