Three years later their leadership is split along generational and theological lines. How did it all come apart?\n\nHow could it not? Not that I agree with any of them even on the smallest issue, but they're more worried about insignificant things than the important. They wanted a ready-made winner, that they could rubber stamp. There wasn't one, because of cross-dresser multiple-wife candidates like Giuliani and heathen Romney were the only ones with any real shot.\n\nSo instead of picking a single secont tier candidate, and throwing their support behind him, they're splintering. Some think Giuliania is a  better bet, he could win... but what's the point if you don't believe in anything he does? Do they actually believe his lies? (God guided me in 9-11...)\n\nOthers think that backing a third party candidate guaranteed to lose will send the message. \n\nAnd the rest are going for whomever they like.\n\nThey could have all solidified around Huckabee or Paul, and made either the candidate they'd have wanted. The gratitude they'd have received would have meant continuing influence.\n\nThe evangelicals are less politically savvy even than myself. And that's saying something.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
