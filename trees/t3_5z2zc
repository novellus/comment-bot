Its obvious that Iran's conventional military could be obliterated in a matter of minutes by the combined strength of Israel and America but are people really so naive to think that Iran will simply turn into a democracy and Israeli loving nation because of it? Of course not, thousands of Iranians will flood into Iraq and Afghanistan with weapons tucked away in there pockets, the entire middle-east will erupt into a proxy war on a scale not seen in decades and the price of oil will implode, damaging the American economy. Consequently, i doubt Egypt , Syria and Jordan will be impressed with Israels decision to bomb there brother.
