As a result, our understanding of the universe as we know it is challenged.\n\nQuantum mechanics itself hasn't been a mystery for decades. It's just trying to understand how certain outcomes are chosen over others that is proving tricky.\n\n&gt; ...what we currently see as chaos. But is it possible that quantum systems can't be understood within the traditional models of science?\n\nThis is tripe. We don't see chaos. We see near-perfect correlation with predictions. And quantum systems *are* understood within traditional models of science. The models of science are positivist, disprovable hypotheses, and QM fits into these.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
