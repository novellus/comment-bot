In some cases, that could lead to exctinction of an entire population, but such cases seem pretty rare in practice.  I touch on some of the reasons below.\n\n&gt; My point is that I think that sexual reproduction homogenates genetics.\n\nWhat makes you think that, considering that every successful pairing produces a unique new combination of genes?  It's actually the opposite: sexual reproduction varies genetic material using a kind of random walk, experimenting with possible combinations of the genome, and is capable of doing so on a large scale, in parallel.  If you imagine all possible configurations of, say, the human genome as an unthinkably large tree, sexual reproduction explores the nodes on that tree.  Some of the branches lead to dead ends, but every viable node has the potential of \"finding\" (spawning) new viable nodes.  Where's the homogenization here?\n\nA very small population clustered in one area of the tree would certainly be at risk: they lack diversity, and might all head down the same dead ends.  But it still requires a lot of bad luck, not to mention poor mating decisions (which sexual reproduction selects against), to eliminate an entire population due to genetic weakness.\n\nYou're essentially suggesting that there's some effect which biases the process towards the dead ends.  However, the nature of the process is such that the bias is in the other direction, towards fitness.  Even the behavior of the gene carriers themselves is biased in this direction: animals look to mate with partners they perceive as fit, so potential mates suffering from genetic diseases are weeded out.\n\nEmpirical evidence seems to be against your conjecture, also.  For example, Northern Elephant Seals were reduced to a very small population in the late 1800s - somewhere in the 100 to 1000 range.  They recovered to over 100,000 after being protected against hunting.  Although that extreme bottleneck still leaves them at some genetic risk today, it nevertheless shows how resilient sexual reproduction can be.  There are many other examples of this.\n\n&gt; Therefore barring some other factor (evolution via beneficial mutations?) the homogenization of a sexual population will become excessive given enough time.\n\nAlthough I believe that the \"therefore\" fails here because the premise is invalid, I'll still ask what kind of timescale you're thinking of?  Clearly it would have to be an enormously long time, since the conjectured effect hasn't yet been observed in nature, afaik.  But if sexual reproduction can succeed for enormously long times, what that means is that populations have representatives all over that tree I mentioned, which makes them much less susceptible to population extinction due to genetic factors.\n\n&gt; * can the example of the Amish be used to predict what is happening to the human race as a whole?\n\nYes and no.  No, in that studies have shown distinctive differences in genetic behavior in small populations, so you can't simply extrapolate from a very small or genetically bottlenecked population to a much larger, more diverse one.  Yes, in that the Amish don't actually seem in much danger of going extinct, even if they lose a significant proportion of their children.  What could help extinct them is the strain on resources of caring for their non-viable children, however.  But that's not a pure genetic effect - if they were more like other animals, leaving non-viable children to die, then all the evidence is that the population as a whole could remain viable, especially if they learned to reduce the most direct forms of inbreeding.\n\n&gt; * is there evidence of a phenomenon that counteracts genetic homogenization?\n\nYes: the fitness-biased randomization that takes place during sexual reproduction.

Here is an excerpt from [this](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~cbbc/courses/bio4/bio4-2000/papers/NomiStone.html) website as to what they decided to do about it:\n\n&gt;Rabbi Joseph Eckstein pioneered an entirely new approach to Tay-Sachs disease in 1985, in light of the fact that he found all the available options either unappealing or irreconcilable with halachic (Jewish) law. His solution: to eliminate the gene from the Jewish population entirely. Eckstein is the founder of an international genetic testing program called Dor Yeshorim, the \"generation of the righteous.\" In the program, Orthodox Jewish high school students are given blood tests to determine if they have the Tay-Sachs gene. Instead of receiving direct results as to their carrier status, each person is given a six-digit identification number. Couples can call a hotline, if both are carriers, they will be deemed \"incompatible.\" Individuals are not told they are carriers directly to avoid any possibility of stigmatization or discrimination. If the information were released, carriers could potentially become unmarriageable within the community. During 1993, 8000 couples were tested, and eighty-seven couples who were previously considering marriage decided against it as they were at risk for having a child with the disease. The program then, aims to eradicate the disease through the venue of choice of mate. \n\nThis has proved to be so successful that nowadays if anyone is born with Tay-Sachs disease, it is almost always someone from the general population and not an Ashkenazi Jew.\n\nIt certainly is a controversial method, but it works for them. It preserves the anonymity and carrier status of each individual while still working to reduce the incidence of disease. I don't know if the same sort of thing could be done in the Amish community, but it does seem to lend itself to their situation since they obviously have no problem with getting genetically screened and it is a closed community.
