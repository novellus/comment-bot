Unlike most other crab I've ever had (snow, king, dungeness (sometimes)), the [blue crab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_crab) is always cooked and served whole, similar to lobster.  The spines around the body aren't that bad, as you can avoid them when opening, which is accomplished by:\r\n* flipping the crab on its back\r\n* prying up the tab covering its genitals\r\n* ripping off said genitals and the tab\r\n* prying the backfin and top shell apart\r\n* scooping out the intestines and removing the gills\r\n* cracking the backfin in half\r\n\r\nThen it comes down to preference. I tend to pull the legs off, starting at the rear and working toward the claws, snapping each joint and pulling/sucking out the meat.  I leave the claws themselves (after removing them) for after I deal with the backfin, which has a bunch of tiny chambers filled with meat.  This can all be done by hand with no tools.\r\n\r\nThe claws have significantly thicker shells than the rest of the beastie, so most people employ a crab mallet and/or a dull knife to aid in cracking each segment.  I tend to exploit the large flat area on the segment closest to the body, applying pressure with my thumbs, then snapping it apart.  The claw segment, you can bend the pincer out, breaking it off and usually liberating most of the meat.  At this point, most would use the mallet/knife to crack in and get at the remainder, while I'll usually exploit the weakness of the shell again, now that most of the supporting meat is gone.\r\n\r\nIt's usually in the claw phase that you risk puncture wounds, due to the spikes on both claw segments.

Unionization makes it so the main thing preventing your ass from getting fired is not your performance but your union card, ensures that the D- people and the A+ people are making the same money (unless the D- person has been around longer, in which case they get paid more), and puts significant pressure on the best workers to work at a lower level in order not to make other people look bad.  \n\nThis leads to the most competent people getting the hell out of there and the least competent sticking around forever.  Over time, quality and expectations go down, and the amount of skill required to do the job trends towards zero.  Over a few years, this leads to a situation where you get no reprimand other than several month's paid leave for bringing a gun to work and threatening a coworker with it, but you can get fired for checking your email from home at night.\n\nServing a group of unionized users makes things fun, too.
