As much as he might disagree with Idang Alibi, and as good as some of his counter-points are, his offensive tone hugely detracts from the article. He also states as facts several things which aren't, just as he accuses the original author: that civilization started in Africa (Mesopotamia), that the pyramids were engineered by black Africans (whether Egyptians were of more African or Middle Eastern descent is disputed). \n\nHe also cites Gabriel Oyibo has having discovered the Grand Unified Theory, when this is largely regarded to be a scam.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Oyibo\n\nAnd Phillip Emeagwali, while contributing to computer design, is certainly not \"Father of the Internet\": http://www.boutell.com/newfaq/history/emeagwali.html\n\nThe author may be justifiably angry, but he comes across as overtly nasty. I would be glad of some solid arguments to contradict what Alibi wrote, as I was originally very sympathetic to it, but I'm utterly put off and left unconvinced by this.\n\n", "author_flair_css_class": null}
