They do, in terms of reasonably occupying a country. In fact, our military supply chain is much larger and more fragile today -- it takes a lot more work to keep an F-15 aloft than it does a soldier in the field.\n\nFair enough, but two points about Iraq:\n\n1. The insurgency's weapon of choice is IED's, not guns. The second amendment doesn't address the former, unless you take a very broad meaning of \"arms\".\n2. The US military in Iraq is following rules of engagement which among other things, attempts to minimize civilian casualty. Saddam had no trouble keeping the same population in line, but he wasn't afraid to break out the chemical weapons (or use the threat of them) to do so. Any hypothetical tyrant would be a lot more like Saddam than the modern US military.\n\n&gt; The fact that one agreed with the federal government in this case side doesn't mean that that one will always do so, though. A large number of people didn't agree.\n\nGranted, but my point is simply that the moral authority/superiority of an armed populace is far from a given; they're as likely to fight on the side of tyranny as not, which seems to make a net wash as constitutional protections go.\n\n&gt; It hasn't come anywhere close to happening yet, and it's pretty low on the list of things that I'd worry about.\n\nWell, there was Oklahoma City.

It happened during the American Civil War.\n\n140 years ago - when gun owners still had (rough) parity with the professional military.\n\nAnd in any case, it only proves my point. Firstly, the south was only able to mount a defense because it was state vs state, not military vs civilians. There still could have/would have been a war even if no civilians could bring their own guns to the battle, because a large chunk of the professional army defected.\n\nAnd secondly, that rebellion was in defense of slavery; they were on the wrong side, morally speaking. Southern blacks nearly didn't gain their freedom because of the second amendment, which in my mind isn't a defense of it.\n\n&gt; There are a number of places in the world in which such military dictatorships have been created. Avoiding unstable situations that can slip into one is not a trivial problem.\n\nAnd there's any number of counterexamples. There have been any number of (relatively) peaceful revolutions, such as with India or the American civil rights movement of the 60's. There have been any number of dictatorships over populations where gun ownership was fairly unrestricted - such as under Saddam Hussein (ie, see how he put down the Kurds way back when), or a number of African dictators. And, both South America and Africa deal with roaming armed militias that often enough are looking to overthrow duly elected governments and install themselves as tyrants - and frankly I have little doubt that there are groups in the US that would do the same given the chance.\n\nIn short, there's not much of a correlation between tyranny and gun ownership, and there's simply not a realistic prospect of civilian gun owners defeating a professional military if it ever came to that.\n\nAgain, I'm fairly neutral as guns go - but this whole \"defense of tyranny\" argument, as true as it might have been in 1789, simply doesn't hold water today.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "politics", "name": "t1_c029ql3", "ups": 1, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5yhz5", "retrieved_on": 1427426186, "score_hidden": false, "body": "[deleted]", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c029qay", "id": "c029ql3", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "politics", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 1, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5yhz5", "retrieved_on": 1427426189, "id": "c029qay", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c029qay", "parent_id": "t1_c029pgo", "body": "Firstly, it wouldn't stand up to Supreme Court scrutiny, and it just wouldn't happen without a constitutional amendment.
