These genetic differences are actually so small that two random humans usually have just as much different DNA as two random people from different \"races\". That is to say, a white man may have less DNA in common with another white man than a black man.\r\nRace is essentially a human-created idea, and has no real scientific basis.\r\nThis is expressed in a number of books documenting the rise and fall of eugenics.

It's well accepted by biologists that race exists, although the categories are different than what most lay people believe. In particular, \"african american\" is not a great category, and is better considered to be a mix of west african, native american and caucasian.\n\nIf you give enough physical characteristics to a computer (skin color, nose size, hair curvature, etc), the computer can divide humans into categories with very small error. If you can find a discriminant function, the categories exist.\n\nUsing genetic markers, you can do the same thing. Give the computer enough data, it will tell you that there are a number of distinct subgroups. These genotype subgroups correspond to phenotype subgroups.\n\nNow pick random people from any one group. Ask them about their race. Almost all will give the same answer. \n\nLike it or not, race exists. It's not necessary for race to be nonexistent for us to pursue equality under the law (or equality of outcome, or group rights, or whatever you like) as a goal. We just need to accept as a premise that all humans are equally deserving of equal treatment. ", "author_flair_css_class": null}
