Can't that problem be solved by looking at the quantum level? (bare with me, I have a remedial understanding of all this at best) Shouldn't electrons spin out of orbit around the nucleus? That's at least what they thought until they realized electrons have wave and particle properties. So couldn't it be that dark matter exists as a wave in this sense and not as a particle?
