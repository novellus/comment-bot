When canidates see they are not getting support they drop out.   By the time Febuary comes around (I live in MN where we are looking a Feb 5 for our date to choose) there will be few canidates left in the race, and there is a good chance only 1 person will be left.   Canidates who don't get early victories generally drop out, and voters in the latter states generally choose between the winners of the early states if there is a choice.\r\n\r\nAlso, early wins will get media attention.  Getting an early win or two is a great way to attact attention.  You cannot dismiss someone as an also-ran if they win the early primaries.\r\n\r\nDon't forget too that you only need a small percent of the vote to win.   Depending on how the other votes split, as little as 15% may win, and 25% is a sounding victory.   In latter states you need more votes.
