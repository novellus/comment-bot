Most of the website -- which I'm assuming mirrors the biographical emphasis of the book -- is devoted to Gandhi's youth in South Africa, decades before the Indian peace movement that made him so famous. I'm sorry, but it's just not news to me that people change over time, and that they may later regret the actions they took or the beliefs they held earlier in their lives.
