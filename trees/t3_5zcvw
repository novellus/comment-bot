How about on/off and we're done?\n\nThat's why TM is great: you plug in a drive, TM asks you if you want to use the drive as a Time Machine disk. Accept and you're done, TM has started working already.\n\nIf you go through the options, there is *one* prominent button called *on/off*, you can't be clearer than that, and the other *two* buttons (that a grand total of 3 buttons for the TM preference pane, versus 7 plus 3 menus for the *very first screen* of Keep) are *change drive* and *options*. And the TM Options button leads to a simple, almost trivial window labeled *do not backup*.\n\nEverything is saved by default, and that's how it should be because the target of TM are people *who don't backup in the first place*. So you clearly want to backup for them.\n\nLast, but not the least, the backup restoration screen. From the Keep screenshots I see, the only thing you get is a date. Can it get even shittier? No preview, no nothing, just a list of dates and then you pray, or spend an hour doing dichotomy searches on your backups until you finally hit the one you were looking for all along?\n\nHere again, Time Machine's great because it:\n\n1. Materializes the stack of backup by creating a \"timeline\" interface. It's tacky, but it makes sense, it shows the user that he can go back and forth through the past, anchors him in some kind of physical world, creates a clear and simple metaphor based into the real world (well not *real* real, but movies and stuff).\n\n2. It allows the user to see *exactly* how things were at that time and to *preview the files* to ensure he gets *the right* version of the file on the first try. Hell, even spotlight works to make TM retrieval even easier.\n\nAnd when the user found his/her file, he/she just has to click the huge *Restore* button, and he goes back to his familiar environment *with his file*. No browsing through, no saying where he wants to restore the backup, dive in, find the file, get out of there.\n\nIn conclusion, Time Machine has a high level of *obviousness* and is anchored in a *physical metaphor* that makes it very easy to use for its target: people who do *not* backup.\n\nKeep doesn't have any of that, and is a typical case of free software versus apple software: feature equivalent, more features even, but unusable if you're not \"in the know\".", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1427424995, "subreddit_id": "t5_2fwo", "created_utc": "1193747376", "ups": 0, "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5zcvw", "downs": 0, "score": 0, "body": "&gt; I was just pointing out that it was easy to implement by hand.\n\nFor whom?\n\nOnly the pretty, usable GUI is relevant in this discussion.

Apple has made something so effect-laden and so extraordinary that users want to see it in action \u2014 the fact that that something is backups, which, let\u2019s face it, is effectively a chore, is a noteworthy achievement. Making backup software that people can\u2019t wait to try, and which, once activated, just automatically kicks in and does its thing on a regular schedule, is like making people want to go ahead and sign up for life insurance.\n&gt;\n&gt;The argument for Time Machine\u2019s game-like UI isn\u2019t that it\u2019s more usable, but that more people will use it.

It\u2019s results that matter most, and the result of Time Machine is going to be that more Mac users will be backing up their data regularly than ever before.
