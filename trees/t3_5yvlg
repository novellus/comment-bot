Sadly, that legislation is left up to the Parliament and the Supreme Court can't do a whole lot about it until then.\n\nThey also outline the fact that the worst part about possession in Canada is the fact that getting charged for it leaves you with a criminal record - generally, those arrested for possession are discharged with only a fine and a record. They point out that this is still a disproportionate penalty for such a minor infraction (if it should be an infraction at all). However, again this is legislation left up to Parliament.\n\nPerhaps the only solution is for constituents to start influencing their MPs for better legislation.
