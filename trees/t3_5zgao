The populace is pessimistic about its government and nation, but happy at home -- happy enough that people aren't willing to risk their contentedness by trying too hard to overturn the apple cart. \n\nAchieving this situation is part of the reason the Bushies have pushed the message, \"keep shopping and leave securing the homeland up to us.\"", "author_flair_css_class": null}
