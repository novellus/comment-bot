It seems like a small number, but I have only received about 25 calls via GC.\n\nOther than that, I love it.  It is great for giving my number out to women in online dating venues.  I can always tick the \"play this number is not in service\" box if she goes all Glenn Close on me.  Haven't had to do that yet.
