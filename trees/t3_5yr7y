You don't go to a predominantly racial neighborhood and indiscriminately tell racial jokes, you don't go to a nursing home and indiscriminately tell jokes about Alzheimers, and you don't go out into the world wearing a shirt that indiscriminately tells a joke about a disease that takes the lives of half a million wives, mothers, sisters, and daughters every year.

It's simple human decency, recognizing that many people may (rightfully) be offended by someone making light of the disease that took their mother, the cancer that took their wife, tying the very serious illness that claimed their sister or their daughter to a puerile expression of sexual immaturity.

Even more, the thought that someone might wear this shirt, indiscriminantly hurting people who aren't ready to joke about the cancer that claimed their loved one but who are probably feeling too much pain to say anything about such insensitivity offends me greatly.\n\n&gt; Can you propose a reasonable alternative to this censorship that would both accomplish your goals and respect individuals' rights to self-expression?\n\nA reasonable alternative?  Cope by telling jokes, if you must.  But be selective around whom you tell such jokes.\n\nAnd if you're not coping; if you haven't lost your mother, wife, sister, daughter, aunt, or grandmother to breast cancer, don't freaking wear a shirt making light of the disease that stole someone else's family member from them.", "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": "1192960746", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "ups": 0, "parent_id": "t1_c02addx", "id": "c02admm", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "score_hidden": false, "ups": -1, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5yr7y", "retrieved_on": 1427425890, "id": "c02addx", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "name": "t1_c02addx", "parent_id": "t1_c02aclj", "body": "It's not a kneejerk.
