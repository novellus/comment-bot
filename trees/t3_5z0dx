What prevents a president then from finding any law that he opposes from being \"in direct conflict\" with his \"understanding of his constitutional responsibilities\"?  The presidency isn't supposed to be a office that shifts adherence to the law ever 4 or 8 years.  The president's veto is when a president is to state that he feels a law is in conflict with his duties.  If that means a law went into effect during a past presidency then the current president must consider that law to not be in conflict.  At no time after a law is passed by Congress and signed by the POTUS does the president have the ability to decide that law no longer applies to him.\n\n&gt;In those cases the president is to ignore what he believes is unconstitutional statute and follow the Constitution.\n\nHighly incorrect.  A president's Constitutional duty is to enforce the laws to the letter.  It's the Supreme Court's duty to determine the constitutionality of a law, not the president.  If the president does believe a law is unconstitutional then he needs to ask Congress to consider a change to the law and/or a petition to the SC to review the law.\n\n&gt;In particular the presidents constitutional obligation to defend the country also can and should take precedence if there is a conflict with statute law.\nThis is debatable.  Nowhere in the Constitution is the president given the duty to \"defend the country.\"  He *is* sworn to protect the Constitution.  To do so he must execute his office as intended, i.e. carry out the laws already passed as written.\n\nNow the POTUS is given command of the military, but that military isn't even supposed to be convened without a declaration from Congress.  It could be concluded that Congress is given the duty to \"protect the country,\" since they are the ones who are supposed to decided when the military is needed.
