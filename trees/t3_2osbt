If we believe God is all powerfull and all knowing then He is not going to be offended by Kathy Griffin's joke.  If anything, He understood the irony and laughed about it Himself.  You Christian's who got offended on God's behalf are not doing Him any favors.  Instead you are reveiling your own insecurity regarding your beliefs by being frightened when someone else thinks differently.", "author": "noveldream", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c02a3y1", "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": "t3_2osbt", "name": "t1_c02a3y1", "author_flair_css_class": null}
