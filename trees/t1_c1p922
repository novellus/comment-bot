I mean, gravity is a given on the surface of this planet, and to emphasize it sounds odd.  \n", "author": "webnrrd2k", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c02b4ag", "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c02b4ag", "parent_id": "t1_c1p922", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}
