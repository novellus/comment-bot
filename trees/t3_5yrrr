It's not so much a matter of having a \"reason\" to break the law, breaking the law is reason-free from cause - usually. It's fairly black and white - obey the law or flout it, you know.\n\nNot really. First, let's distinguish between \"wrong\" and \"illegal\", as one belongs to morality and another to compliance with the law. Just as the people's acts can be wrong, law can be wrong as well, since it is derived from acts of the people. When a law is ratified, it merely comes into force; it does not by itself become right, and breaking it does not become wrong. This means that it is entirely possible that there is a malicious law in force. \n\nThe act of breaking the law is punishable by the law, but it is not necessarily morally wrong. Law in principle can not provide you with an answer on whether a given act is morally wrong or not; it only reflects and enforces a generic will of the majority, which is to be interpreted by lawmakers, judges, juries and attorneys, often to the point that two identical acts would yield wildly different verdicts. People, and not the letter of the law, make the decisions.\n\nIt is absolutely not black and white.\n\n&gt;I disagree. I think that drug prohibition is totally right, fits in with morality and the spirit of law. I think that production, distribution, possession or consumption of drugs is entirely wrong.\n\nNo. For a moment, let's examine the possibility that a law has been passed that does not reflect the will of the people, and thus does not serve the people. Such a law is therefore self-defeating and should be struck down. The technical procedure of doing so is irrelevant; it is the principle that matters.  There is no shortage on this kind of laws; corruption is rampant and corporate lobbyism flourishes. Monetary interests substitute morality as the motivator behind law; just ask the RIAA about the DMCA. This corruption is typical of civil law, where monetary interest matter most; the criminal law, however, deals with something much more important than money, and that is liberty and dignity of human beings. It is absolutely and completely unacceptable that the criminal law is to be used by non-public interests as a vehicle to maintain power over the public. I hope I don't need to elaborate why.\n\nBecause of their nature, drug possession and use violations are victimless crimes. There is space in the criminal law in which the society can create regulatory mechanisms to enforce certain social norms. Victimless crimes, infringing on people's values rather than individual rights, belong in that space; there is no question that if there *is* a legitimate reason to do so, it is absolutely possible to institute drug prohibition laws.\n\nThe question is, of course, whether there is a legitimate reason to do so at all, and whether the current prohibition laws serve such a legitimate reason; and if they do, how well do they serve it. \n\nThere is dispute about the former. The latter two, however, are very clearly documented and there's hardly any argument about the utter social and economical failure that is War on Drugs. Suffice is to say that in America, it made a few select bunch of crooks and criminals very rich at the expense of a few million people losing their liberty, achieving literally nothing while promoting racism, funding illegal government operations and international terrorist activities, all while fostering corruption and gang violence, seeding distrust towards the law into young minds, taking precious law enforcement resources off murderers and rapists and wasting tremendous sums of public money which could've gone into education, healthcare and other *actual* problems.\n\nIs drug use wrong? In some cases, yes, but universally, no. I have no obligation before you to be healthy - as you can only see drugs as a health issue - any more than I have an obligation to be well dressed or have a skin of a certain color. You might think that you have an obligation to yourself, but I don't necessary share it, and you have no right to force it upon me as long as I am not violating your rights. The fact is that recreational drug users do not violate your rights.\n\n&gt; My interpretation of anti-drug law is that drugs can have an incredibly harmful effect on people\n\nWell, here's your problem right there. You should be interpreting hard scientific evidence for each and every kind of drug, and not laws.\n\n&gt; I've known people wonder in front of cars whilst high and take the inevitable damage - and there are countless cases of health drawbacks ranging from schizophrenia to illness to organ failure to instant death from drug consumption.\n\nSo? Your concern is appreciated, but uninvited. Adults are capable of making their own choices, no matter how fatal, and sacrifice themselves for any cause, no matter how dumb. You can always be compassionate and help a person in need; but you can't have people do that to themselves for you by the power of law just in case they wanna do something silly when you're not around. That is absurd. You're not father to anyone who isn't your own child.\n\n&gt; Besides this, in which the law is clearly meant to protect people from their own lapse in judgment, the laws against production and distribution stop criminal elements such as makers and dealers from spreading drugs and, by association, spreading the damage that drugs brings to lives, both of the individual and his/her family/friends.\n\nIn theory. In practice, there is supply and there is demand. In the real world, as long as there is demand, no matter how many drug dealers you put in prison, new ones will come. There is demand and there will be even more demand in a world which is suddenly exposed to global stress and information overload; where information about drugs and their true effects is openly available to anyone and an adult can make an educated choice; and where children are attracted to new experiences based solely on the fact that their instructors lied to them about it. So, the drug trade will go on, and the money will go to the criminals, which in turn will actually destroy more lives and corrupt more officials.\n\nSo which is better: illegal drug traffic that causes crime, can represent serious health threats where none should be (as is the case with cannabis) and enriches criminals, or regulated legal production, which enforces quality control, promotes education, allows legitimate medical research, and gives back in the form of taxes, while reducing the aversion of society towards the police? It really is one or the other. You can't not have both.\n\n&gt; I think there is a concern to both save people from themselves \n\nThe concern to save people from themselves is illegitimate. It roots itself in the good ole' christian tradition of saving souls against their will. It is a direct outcome of religious fiction being imposed on people's minds: you reap what you sow, bullshit in both cases. Aside of religious touchy feely crap, there isn't an actual reason for you to be trying to save people from themselves preemptively. Education is as far as you can go unless you want to assert a position of moral superiority and invade people's lives which would eventually land you in a hospital.\n\n&gt; ... and also to save them from those willing to introduce them (at varying degrees of willingness) into a dangerous game.\n\nYou assume that there's necessary someone malicious that drags people into the, er, game, and that the game is dangerous. Try proving it.\n\n&gt; I don't quite follow. This seems utterly ridiculous. \n\nEither you've been living in a bubble, or you're trolling and this is a complete waste of time.

Neither is the case.\n\n&gt; I think the reasons for the creation of drugs law have a basis less in the fantastical and more in the practical.\n\nIt might've seemed practical to people whose only mass media was newspapers and who wouldn't have the means to see past lies and shilling of special interests. Today, however, that doesn't work anymore, and it is also the reason why the drug laws as we know them today will be repealed.\n\n&gt; I think saying that making gay marrige and sex and gun control illegal ARE violations of rights and freedoms, however, these are things that are not detrimental to wider society, whereas drugs are.\n\nSome are and some aren't.
