I think we both now understand the debate is about the origin of life, time and existence. Abiogenesis being part of it.\n\n&gt; \"Time\" does not replicate, and as such, cannot \"evolve\". You sure you understand evolution?\n\nI was trying to put it into context for you and not get into semantic details. You seem to be willing to debate the topic, so we should leave the ad hominem attacks aside.\n\nYour claim is apparently that time had no beginning and is infinite. My claim is that time did in fact have a beginning. We both have evidence that time itself exists and nothing else. \n\nBoth hypotheses are equally valid with the evidence we have of time currently existing. We shouldn't simply declare them useless and ignore the topic, because we do have the evidence of time existing. \n\nScience is about searching for answers using hypotheses and not declaring them as useless ideas before any testing has been completed nor the results analyzed.\n\n&gt;&gt; So if every theory is invalidated as you just suggested, doesn't that make \"all ideas equally cogent\"?\n\n&gt; What? No. Some theories have predictive power, and are based on evidence.\n\nSo what predicative power does the atheistic claim to the beginning of the universe hold? What evidence does it have that is greater than a theist claim?\n\nSee again you're trying to throw all hypotheses out the window, because atheism doesn't have an working hypothesis at the moment. I'm sure once it does produce one, then all of a sudden the topic is back on the table again.\n\nSo the trend I see here is that until science can produce a working theory, then all other theories are meaningless and thrown out the window! In other words don't bother atheists until the science is ready.\n\n&gt; That's pretty good odds compared to God, because you have no (or very little) evidence that God exists at all, which is why it's implausible to believe he does.\n\nSo again you're arguing that because of my lack of evidence that the opposite is true.\n\nMy evidence is simply that we exist and therefore were created at some distant point of time, this you can't refute, so you attribute it a meager value as evidence. Lets say this gives god's existence the percentage value of 1%.\n\nNow your position is that because I have only produced a 1% claim of evidence, that the opposite argument is 99% that he doesn't exist. That is false logic.\n\nFor example, I have virtually no evidence that President Bush is carrying money right at this moment. It doesn't not logically follow that he doesn't have any money on him just because I can't produce the evidence to this fact.\n\nLack of evidence on my part doesn't support your claim, just like the lack of evidence (nor a hypothesis) on your side doesn't support my claim.\n\nYou forgot to discuss Occam's razor. God still provides the simplest explanation for the creation of time, matter and life itself.\n\nYour analysis using Occam's razor is that we reduce the question, evidence and explanation to its simplest components and are left with what? no answer at all.\n\nI'm sorry I don't see how you can claim the nonexistence of God from a failure to produce even a simple hypothesis.

You have pretty good evidence that I am a human (I speak like one, you don't know of any robots that are as convincing, etc). Therefore, you can theorize that I am a human, and have about a 50% chance that I am a human male.\r\n\r\nIn other words, you have a theory with very good evidence which posits a 50% chance of me being male.\r\n\r\nThat's pretty good odds compared to God, because you have *no* (or very little) evidence that God *exists at all*, which is why it's implausible to believe he does.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c02bz2d", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 0, "link_id": "t3_5zb2p", "retrieved_on": 1427425071, "body": " &gt; That is not proof, in the slightest, of God.

Maybe the rate dust falls onto the moon has not always been what it is today 2). We don't think NASA really was expecting a thick layer of dust 3). [goes with 1] Not sure how old the moon is given the layer of dust currently on the moon.\n\nSO once again the evolutionists say the ID-theorists are stupid, wrong, etc; yet they themselves are proposing an alternative just as preposterous to a 100% scientific conclusion as ID is: that the ID followers should follow these evolutionists who have no repeatable means of verifying the true age of the universe. Remember, if you can't repeat the events in a closed system, it's a theory and not science.\n\nAt the end of the day, the evolutionists think the universe spontaneously erupted into existence. That they point fingers at proponents of ID for not being consistent is ironic. That they then try to prove with \"theoretical physics\" that things can, and apparently do spontaneously erupt into existence is grasping at straws.\n\nBut what's worse is the nasty manners and name calling that goes on over such a trifle [if you are an evolutionist] matter. You're not going to convince them by name calling; in fact you're going to just further their cause that \"the world is evil\" \"people are sinful\" etc, because \"look how nasty they are when we simply mention an alternative\".\n\nSo, a word of advice: let the ID theorists believe what they want; let them preach it too while you preach your thing, and everybody just focus on being nice to each other.
