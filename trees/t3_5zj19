A small town (pop. 30,000, much of it new) which recently (less than 10 years ago) became home to a new Walmart and K-Mart.  The income of the town is primarily from outlying gold mines and is variously (depending on the price of Au) growing and shrinking, wealthy and poor.\n\nFifteen years ago Elko did not have any of the superstores it does today.  In addition to Walmart and K-Mart, there is a Raleys, an Albertsons, a Smiths, and a Home Depot.  When the superstores moved in the effect was, as Vash pointed out, to put most of the local competition out of business almost immediately.  There are several local businesses that do not compete with Walmart, such as accountants, but primarily the remaining shops are, contrary to your point, still in business precisely because they are \"quaint\" to an extreme degree.  These are curio shops and high end clothing stores which remain in business because of their almost touristy attraction.  When the super stores moved in, the local hardware store, music shop, toy store, pharmacy, video store, 3 grocers, stereo shop, some bakeries, several automotive centers, and many other businesses all went under in less than two years.\n\nElko has continued to grow and maintain a strong economy over the years, but there are many other factors contributing to this.  Gold has been doing well and many people from California have moved there to escape the CA housing market.  Though it is difficult to distinguish the precise effect of the superstores because of the other factors I would say that in general it has been bad.  People who previously owned businesses, involved themselves in the local government and economy, and contributed their unique establishment to the local color, are now door greeters and cashiers and are no more distinguishable than any of the other +1 million Walmart zombies.  The money generated from the business is now piped into the pockets of stock brokers and corporate executives halfway across the continent instead of being circulated back into the local economy.  And for what it's worth, I would rather live in a community of business owner/operators than badly uniformed corporate drones.\n\nFinally, I would point out that no one fusses when an independently owned store closes in a place like D.C. because the total impact on the economy is small.  If Walmart and Kmart were to simultaneously close shop in Elko the total impact would be huge and it would take several years for the economy to recover and independently run businesses to become reestablished.
