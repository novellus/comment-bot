Militarism and neoconservativism are running rampant with no opposition party to restrain them.  The media has largely abandoned its mission to reveal the lies of politicians.  Private contractors are embezzling millions of dollars from government war funding.  Our national reputation is being abused by defense contractors who spread wanton death and destruction with impunity.  Everywhere in the world, the United States is regarded as one of the most dangerous powers, prone to unreasonable, unjustified unilateral action.\n\nAnd there are domestic problems as well, perhaps just as troubling, though I won't dwell on them right now because everyone has their own idea of what's most important when it comes to domestic issues.\n\nI don't want to go down as a member of the generation that did nothing but watch the collapse of what was once a well-liked, peaceful nation and perhaps took the world with it - Bush recently linked Iranian knowledge of nuclear weaponry to World War III.  Will we have the courage to take action, and more importantly, what action will we take?  Which brings me to the central question, as posed in the headline.\n\nWhat are your solutions?  How do we fix our nation, ignoring for now the possibility that there may never have been a time when it was not \"broken\"?\n\nI'll start off by recommending a change as soon as possible to approval voting or another reasonably mathematically sound system which prevents the spoiler effect.  Naturally direct recording electronic voting machines and other unverifiable and insecure machines should be prohibited but as long as we're voting for the least of two evils I don't see any possibility of real change.\n\nI would love to hear other suggestions, particularly those that can be implemented locally.", "author": "[deleted]", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c029y8t", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "politics", "name": "t1_c029y8t", "parent_id": "t3_5ymc1", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}
