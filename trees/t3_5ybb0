It's bad enough that I convey the information which attempts to communicate the experience; futility at it's worst.  What's worse is the temptation to twist the information to  carry interpretation.

A more visceral awareness of alone-ness, nothingness.\n\nSo, two different things: Knowing what you are, and realizing what you are.\n\nIt's hard to explain, but easier to make an analogy. I'm not sure if everyone can relate to what I'm saying here, but here goes:\n\nYou can think about the fact that you will die someday, right? Pretty much any time. But, I've had very deep and disturbing realizations that I'm going to die, which are extremely difficult to achieve. To actually realize is very different from simple knowing.\n\nAnyways, \"to go beyond the easily realized, temporary status of the self,\" huh? Oh, I think that applies to me. It's hard not to go beyond that conventional, typical state when you become aware that nothing you can ever say or do will ever be experienced by any other being. The impossibility to communicate a single shred of information.\n\nBesides that, There's no way to even know that the \"atoms\" you refer to even remotely exist. Since the methods by which we verify scientific data is heavily reliant upon our own senses to analyze that data. The universe might be an organic web, nothing alike to what it seems to be, that expands and molds to our ideas of itself, therefore (through our senses) manifesting itself as somewhat stable and predictable.\n\nAnother thing, there's no way to know what the \"You\" exists either. It may seem that you are you, and that there is something or other, but it is also possible to realize that none of these things are even remotely accurate.\n\nThat is a host of problems to consider and I do believe, nevertheless, in a state of deep and immediate awareness of these possibilities, rather than relaxed pondering, this state may be impossible to cope with.\n\nBy the way, Nihilism can be portrayed in many different lights.
