Also inkscape was already around so people would use that if they wanted free anyway, but having Xara as a choice would have increased awareness of it, I doubt I would never have heard of it if it wasn't for the opensourcing and I wouldn't have bothered with it over inkscape. My not releasing a necessary component they imminently killed developers interests in the product, other than replacing that part with something else but that never happened.\n\nPeople have been known to purchase burned copies of OpenOffice off eBay and many people will buy it and Linux distros (even when they don't want the support) off the shelf in boxes.\n\nVector graphics software isn't something that is marketed to individuals much.
