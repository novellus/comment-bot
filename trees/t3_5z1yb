My personal feeling is that you can keep your cultural upbringing if you want, I would prefer if you didn't and just act how you feel.  But don't make it a big deal.  Like some Christian religious zealots I know of.  And certainly don't impose on my believes; \"Hey, my culture says I can't drink alcohol that means you can't either\", that kind of nonsense.  Also, if you grew up in a traditional Chinese upbringing, but you really dig the hiphop culture; why not go for the hiphop culture.  You shouldn't feel guilty.  Also, outside of the work environment, social environment, it starts to get tricky.  Even in dating.  Me personally, I think we should all be friends.  As long as you are human, I think we should be able to get along.  Now, Humans and Lions that may be a difficult union to pull off.\r\n\r\nEg, the development team I work with is half American and half originally from different parts of the globe and has always been that way as I have developed.  Nigeria, Korea, Indian, Britain, China are a few of the different places of the people I have worked with.

The live in the same society and tolerate each other's differences. *Not* tolerating those differences, forces cultures into the same mold and they begin to mix. In Canada, there are laws that apply to everyone except perhaps a single culture. For instance, it is understandably illegal to carry any sort of weapons in Canadian high-schools, unless you're a Sikh male. Then you're allowed to carry a \"kirpan\", a ceremonial dagger. The Canadian court ruling on the issue stated that banning the kirpan would be, \"disrespectful to believers in the Sikh religion, and does not take into account Canadian values based on multiculturalism.\" If anything, this sort of tolerance maintains a divide between different cultures, which is fine if that's what the cultures want. Multiculturalism avoids doing anything that forces the culture of one group onto another yet provides those groups with a means to coexist (not necessarily mix) in society.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02b5co", "id": "c02b5gt", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "ups": 0, "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5z1yb", "retrieved_on": 1427425527, "id": "c02b5co", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02b5co", "parent_id": "t1_c02b57n", "body": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "name": "t1_c02b57n", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 1, "link_id": "t3_5z1yb", "retrieved_on": 1427425529, "body": "The headline displays a big misunderstanding of multiculturalism. The idea behind multiculturalism is to maintain cultural differences, not to blur them. As the cited wikipedia entry states, this can be problematic for countries that already have distinct cultural identities but this doesn't apply to newer, immigrant nations like the US and Canada, that don't really have a distinct cultural identity of their own. The question in these countries is, \"Do we try to fuse all of the cultural influences into a single cultural identity or do we allow the different cultures to retain their distinctions?\" Without being any sort of specialist in the field, just based on my experience of having lived for extended periods in a country with a distinct cultural identity, the US and Canada, I would say that the US attempts to fuse its various cultures into a single one (whether or not it does so consciously) whereas Canada does all it can to foster cultural multiplicity with flexible legislation. So the answer is no, multiculturalism in the true sense of the term, will not end the world's cultural diversity.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5z1yb", "id": "c02b57n", "author_flair_css_class": null}
