That's so incredibly lame it's laughable from the party that simultaneously tried to embrace Libertarians, fiscal conservatives, social conservatives and reglious fundamentalists. \r\n\r\n*Party Branding* - Good grief you'd think we were considering which flavor of Colgate Palmolive toothpaste to compare to which flavor of Proctor Gamble toothpaste. Ho hum, nothing to see here just another meaningless consumer choice. Make your choice, pay your bucks and get out of the real decision making process.\r\n\r\nAs much as I'm opposed to Ron Paul as President, I hope he busts the failed GOP wide open and shines some much needed light into how broken the whole Washington political machine is on all sides.
