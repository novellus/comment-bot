Not as close together as the article says but I assume it was some kind of distributed brute forcing. I get around 3000 failed attempts a day.\n\nI actually modified the code to OpenSSH to log these password, I had a huge list of all the fake username/passwords. I then googled some entries from the list and found a server that seemed to have been some kind of crackers dumping ground. It contained a bucn of scanners and log files with successful logins although they where quite dated most of them where closed or false positives (such as allowing the login but then killing the connection), 2 however did work I think they went bothered with because they where doggy cygwin systems rather than actual Linux/unix had no way to contact the owners though.\n\nMight be worth having some people setup fake tar/honeypot servers that allow all the connections and appear to work but aren't actually any use. For instance it could allow logging in and setting up their scanner then the first 100 external ip lookups so they can get their server setup and test it but not enough thet they are likely to actually scan a system then fake all traffic after that to make it appear legitimate but return bad traffic for the scanners.
