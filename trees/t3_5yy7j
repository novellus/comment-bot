I didn't go into detail because I thought that the technical information provided in that article was sufficient.  I don't even think this is still an argument that informed truthers use.\r\n\r\nThere was also significant information that you either don't believe or don't know about and that is the fact that there were fires raging unchecked for 7 hours in WTC7.  Furthermore, the building was nailed by debris from the crashing twin towers which \"gutted\" the building.\r\n\r\nSo, considering that I believe these facts to be true, do you think I am wrong for thinking that it is not surprising WTC7 fell?\r\n\r\nJust so you have a little background on my education, I have a bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering and I currently work as a Systems Engineer.  When 9/11 ocurred I was in college and I was taking Thermodynamics.  In my class after the attacks my teacher brought us through a rough calculation of the heat involved in the fires that would be burning in the towers.  I will grant that these numbers were just rough calculations based on estimates of what materials were involved in the fires, but its still reasonably accurate to decide whether it is plausible or not that the towers fell.\r\n\r\nThe calculations showed that it was very likely that the heat would prove to be too much for steel to retain enough of its structural integrity to keep the buildings up.\r\n\r\nI hope this gives you some insight into why I believe the story presented to us (at least with regards to why the buildings fell).  My teacher was not a political person, he is a very reputable professor at a very good acredited college.  I KNOW him and what he taught me has proven to be true many times over.  Therefore, with my background and the experts that I have personally talked to, I find the PM/NIST/Government story to be very plausible and most likely true.  I have seen no information that has shaken my confidence even a little bit that there was no controlled demolition or missiles or direct government involvement in the attacks.  They may have been negligent, but they weren't complicit.\r\n\r\nI have a logical question for you.  Why would the government even risk controlled demolition of the towers when they could just have easily used the terrorists to actually perpetrate the crime?  That is the conspiracy theory that would scare me, because it would be easy to cover up.  Far less people involved and the people who might know about it are considered terrorists.  \r\n\r\nSo from my point of view, it is patently illogical to try and pull of such a complex engineering feat bringing down the towers was really unnecessary.  The same fear and anger would have resulted from just the 2 towers being struck by planes.\r\n", "author": "lumpy1981", "archived": true, "author_flair_text": null, "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "name": "t1_c02bc1f", "parent_id": "t1_c02bal9", "id": "c02bc1f", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "politics", "ups": 2, "name": "t1_c02bal9", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5yy7j", "retrieved_on": 1427425389, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02bal9", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02b8pn", "body": "ok now i see you are just denying this with no thinking sorry.  you say people are vague, then find a person who was specific, and say he is just wrong.\n\n\"Anyone who has a basic understanding of physics and engineering knows that a hollow alluminum shell is not going to create a hole in a reinforced building that is going to be of a size close to the plane.\"\n\nso what created the hole?

I look at these numbers and I am not surprised.  Also, the vast majority of the responses that were made were either very vague (for people like General Clark and others who weren't part of organizations for 9/11 truth) or bases on believing everything they are told is a lie.\r\n\r\nSure there are some very reputable people on that list, but far fewer than are on the research lists.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if you want to make a guess at whether the website creator isn't at least bending truth to make it look more significant just take a look at how many people are repeated in multiple categories.  i.e. it says Military (110) then aviatiators (60).  A lot of those people are listed in both categories.  So if you were to just add up how many people are on the list, it claims 860 or at least misleads you to believe 860 (which I already feel is pretty insignificant since one of the categories is entertainers) when really many of the people listed are repeated in multiple categories.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I think people should continue to seek more information about this and question conclusions that were drawn, but I think these people need to take an unbiased approach.  Most of the reasons that truthers use as their main reasons for disbelief are out right wrong.\r\n\r\nFor instance Major Genera Albert Stubblepine said he didn't believe because the plane does not fit in that (created in the pentagon).  You have got to be kidding me.  Anyone who has a basic understanding of physics and engineering knows that a hollow alluminum shell is not going to create a hole in a reinforced building that is going to be of a size close to the plane.\r\n\r\nIt is poor understanding and denial of facts by calling them lies or unbelievable based on personal belief that is behind the truth movement.

However, NISTs report which the entire part of that PM article I linked was based on did talk about tower 7 in their report.\r\n\r\nThe thing I think is very indicative of truthers is that most of their argument is based on intuition.  I know you don't exactly style yourself a truther and I actually think you are willing to concede to certain facts which is not indicative of true truthers.  However, you made a few statements within your response that I hear every time I am debated on this issue.  Not the exact wording, but the jist of the statement its use in your logic.  Here are a few I mean:\r\n\r\n\"there is no way possible for building 7 to have fallen the way it did naturally.  just google pictures of buildings that fell due to earthquake-they stay intact!\"\r\n\r\n\"why is it that people harp on those guys making a mistake or two...they just raise questions.  Good questions imo.\"\r\n\r\n\"how could popular science determine...Doesn't that make you more suspicious?\"\r\n\r\n\"as for Popular Mechanics...they are almost risking their safety...\"\r\n\r\nThe first one shows you probably don't have a background in science or you are unconsciously letting your intuition get the better of you.  For you to say there is no way it could have fallen and then use earthquakes as an example of why is wrong.  Skyscrapers are very resistant to collapse during earthquakes, they are made that way.  They sway and and windows blow out, but unless its an incredibly strong and extended earthquake, they will survive in good shape.  They are also resistant to fire or impact, but if a fire rages unchecked after significant impact for hours at a time, the building will do as tower 7 did and buckle.  These are scientific facts and there is math and simulations and science behind it.  The same science that tells us the earth is warming, put men on the moon, created our global communications boom, etc.  You can't really pick and choose when to believe in it.\r\n\r\nThe second comment I listed about the Loose Change guys is also common.  It is not about harping on their mistakes, its about harping on the fact that they neglect facts or explainations outright for reasons that are really not justifiable.  In that video, which was barely moderated, the loose change guys final argument for everything was \"your a liar.\"  Simple as that.  Thats not an argument.\r\n\r\nThe third thing I mentioned about PM being able to determine these things 6 years later.  They didn't determine these things, NIST did per what they said in the article.  They also gave a source for every answer they provided.  PM makes people suspicious because they want to believe it was a conspiracy, consciously or subconsciously their mind is made up (I realize you could say the same about me which again shows the futility of this argument except I have far more and more diverse and more expert people in agreement).\r\n\r\nThe last thing I said can sort of tag along with the previous paragraph.  You are suspicious of PM so you discount them, you don't understand so you discount them.  I actually think the PM guys are very polite to the truthers in their rebuttals on that video and in print.  They acknowledge that the people advocating for this movement are passionate and patriotic, but they are wrong and believe so many things that are categorically false.\r\n\r\nIt is exasperating to try and change what someone believes.  That is the problem 9/11 truthers BELIEVE in their movement and in the conspiracy and like religion science can't open their eyes to truth.\r\n\r\nI think the best take on the 9/11 truth movement is the south park episode about it, with the Hardly boys.  If you haven't seen it I suggest you watch it.\r\n\r\nFinally, I will say that I do not think the 9/11 truthers are unpatriotic and I believe most of their hearts are in the right place, but I think it has spiraled out of control and many of them have gotten caught up in it to the point they cannot believe they might be wrong.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02b3l5", "id": "c02b40w", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "name": "t1_c02b3l5", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "ups": 2, "link_id": "t3_5yy7j", "retrieved_on": 1427425550, "id": "c02b3l5", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02b1a8", "body": "I have seen that site before. \n\nI just want to point out, there is no such thing as 'scientifically proven'.

And in reality... the loose change guys are a bunch of kids.  no offense to them.  \n\nwhy is that people harp on those guys for making a mistake or two, they are NOT scientists.  no one should take what they say as Fact, and from what i have seen, they dont claim to have proven anything at all... they just raise questions.  Good questions imo.  \n\nI think their mistake is exactly as you said - they put a lot of stock into witness statements, hearing explosions.  There are other things that could cause that.  By harping on those things, it looks like they are grasping at straws.\n\nImo, there is no way possible for building 7 to have fallen the way it did naturally.  just google for pictures of buildings that fell due to earthquake- they stay intact!  they retain their shape, just topple over... to me, its enough that everything is questionable...\n\nas for Popular Mechanics, I read the article, i saw them on the History channel show.

I can give you one site that is really good, but like you said it is just run by some people who didn't think the truther's story made any sense (which it really doesn't).\r\n\r\nThe Popular Mechanics guys went on a TV show and debated the Loose Change guys and made them look like the stupid kids they are.  Their explaination is backed up with a blbliography that includes all of their sources primary and secondary.  \r\n\r\nThe question you should ask when faced with a Truther's evidence is \"why?\" and \"what does that mean exactly?\"  For instance, what would the government have to gain by collapsing Tower 7?  The building was evacuated, the big towers had already fallen and caused thousands of deaths and massive and ubelievable destruction.  Why would building 7 be intentionally destroyed?\r\n\r\nSo, the thing is, almost all of the 9/11 truth stuff is anecdotal or out of context.  For example they put a lot of stock in people hearing noises such as explosions and such and use them to fuel doubt that the planes were what caused all the destruction.  The truth is, that day was so chaotic, that basically everyone was confused and scared and it is well known that those are the worst conditions for people to accurately remember events and timelines.\r\n\r\nBasically, for me, I have heard the 9/11 truther's stories I have seen their 'evidence' and I have heard the explainations from Pop. Mechanics and debunkers.  I have made a decision based upon probability and feasibility and I have found that the chances that the government was involved in these events is effectively 0.  The thing is, there is no real evidence that points to a conspiracy.  There are some small inconsistencies and unknowns, but that is completely understandable given the massive scale of the entire event.  If you took 10 people from that day and asked them all the same questions, you would get 10 very different answers.  Thats the nature of witnesses.\r\n\r\nSo, I will give you the site I think is the best, but I will concede that it is no more official than a truth site.  I would be interested to hear what you have to say about the site and what you thought was wrong, right, insightful, opinion changing (if applicable). \r\n\r\nhttp://www.debunking911.com/", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02b1a8", "parent_id": "t1_c02ax4v", "id": "c02b1a8", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1427425580, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "archived": true, "name": "t1_c02b1by", "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5yy7j", "downs": 0, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "body": "http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military_law/1227842.html", "author": "lumpy1981", "created_utc": "1193237250", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "politics", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_c02ax4v", "id": "c02b1by", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "name": "t1_c02ax4v", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "ups": 2, "link_id": "t3_5yy7j", "retrieved_on": 1427425634, "id": "c02ax4v", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02auvc", "body": "i havent looked into it much lately, but... how did they prove things 'scientifically'?  iirc, the 9/11 Commission report couldnt say what happened to WTC7.  \n\nThen, years later, without the millions of dollars the 9/11 commission had... popular science figures it out?
