(I believe the original quote for that came from SICP.)\n\nOf course, if you have a program that's a little pokey on current hardware, and you can fix it to run acceptably with some optimization (keeping in mind maintainability concerns), sure, you should fix it.  But, if speeding it up enough on current hardware involves contorting the code to the \"WTF?\" point (defined as the point where, when you go back and look at the code in a couple months, your first reaction is \"WTF?\"), then consider not doing that particular optimization.  It's not saying \"write simple code even if it's slow because machines will be fast enough to handle it in a few months/years.\"", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2fwo", "created_utc": "1193076365", "name": "t1_c02alpp", "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5ytzd", "retrieved_on": 1427425782, "score": 4, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02alpp", "author": "dlsspy", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "programming", "ups": 4, "parent_id": "t1_c02akrj", "body": "I've repeatedly seen micro-optimization suggestions be reversed by newer compilers.\n\nSimple example:  Most of the old java StringBuffer based building people did instead of using string concatenation now performs *worse* than string concatenation (and it's harder to read and write).", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "programming", "name": "t1_c02akrj", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "ups": -5, "link_id": "t3_5ytzd", "retrieved_on": 1427425794, "id": "c02akrj", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5ytzd", "body": "\"\nAnd don't write longer, more obtuse code because you think it's faster.
