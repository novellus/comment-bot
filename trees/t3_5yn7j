Nazi rule took a country which, although crippled by a lost war, reparations and a *completely* *home-made* willfully created inflation, was already bouncing back to more normal conditions, and in many aspects still was on top of the world (literature, science, arts).  They transformed it, within 6 years (not 15), to a country at the verge of complete moral, intellectual and fiscal bankruptcy.  The whole ecomonical concept was to steal from Peter (or, often, Ibrahim) to pay Paul.  They forbade women to work (of course, this meant men got jobs), they brutally abused prisoners (mostly politicial ones) in forced work to continue the autobahn project, they stole from basically anyone without a lobby in the Partei, they had the whole heavy industry geared towards war production, and had debts beyond believe.  \n\nNot to mention they already killed all main streams of literature, philosophy and art in germany (Thomas Mann's books were burned and he became Princeton professor, for god's sake) by their Juden-Raus-Idiocy, crippled almost all natural and social sciences severely and basically flattened what once was a mountain of culture and knowledge to a barren inhabitated by shouting brutes looking for a new victim.  \n\nAnd all that was before the war even started, and completely leaves out the horror of the Holocaust.  Those bastards killed **everything** what was good in Germany or perverted it to support their war delusions.  Germany did not recover fully from these blows until today.
