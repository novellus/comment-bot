Generations are required to build global confidence in a currency. However, that confidence can be lost in a matter of a few years and rebuilding it can take decades. The Weak Dollar policy is creating inflation and causing reductions in the exports for US trade partners, especially in Europe. Business confidence in the euro zone is low and falling dramatically as a result. The Fed is relying on a Weak Dollar policy versus on domestic monetary reflation via rate cuts that would ordinarily have occurred at this point in the economic cycle. The ultimate costs of the Weak Dollar policy are yet to be felt.", "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5zg75", "name": "t1_c02c6mu", "author_flair_css_class": null}
