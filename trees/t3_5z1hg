What if that site held a clever blog post that made the front page of reddit and sparked a lively discussion in the comments section. Without the original post, the comments lose context, and can sometimes make no sense.\r\n\r\nTake a look at a few really old stories that you dugg/saved, how many of them are still around?\r\n\r\nHowever, if you used reddit to post your story, this problem is gone. Reddit has an amazing commenting system, with threading, voting up and down of comments and something that makes conversations seem really natural.\r\n\r\nMaybe this could be the next step of blogging? No longer would the main post be the focus of the attention, and comments merely a side attraction. But a blog post is just the start of a conversation.", "author": "saralk", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c02b3ny", "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": "t3_5z1hg", "name": "t1_c02b3ny", "author_flair_css_class": null}
