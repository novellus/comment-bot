Would make those games easier to create and manage.\n\nThe face and the voice are really unnecessary. The voice recognition was a nice touch, but like the face and the text to speech are unrelated to the real work done here, in english sentence parsing, construction and relationship mapping. All very impressive.\n\nKudos to the developer. I wouldn't call this an AI, because in this demonstrated mode it's too passive. It responds cleverly along the old ELIZA script models, but it doesn't drive the conversation ever. It smoothly is re-queued by external requests which is nice, and it handles garbled input like laughter and background noise nicely.\n\nI can easily imagine limited version of this running farmers and merchants in video game fantasy  world towns, happily talking with players and spreading news and gossip around the kingdom as well as reacting to game events and player  specific events in an engaging way. But I think young child companion is a bad idea, as it doesn't have  a drive to know how to engage the infant. It could certainly act for example as a tout in video games, giving new players the lay of the land, and providing them directions to locations or how in game concepts work, demonstrating, aiding and accompanying them. Perhaps making it harder for casual abuse. I imagine trying to act as a referee in game may tax its limits as it attempts to resolve human to human disputes.\n\nSo yes this is a useful breakthrough. As long as it doesn't drive itself, it's not really AI though. Though this SYLVIA is a great thing.
