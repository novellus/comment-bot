Many people need hope, wisdom and inspiration. \r\n\r\nAs a way of helping everyone in San Diego and Los Angeles successfully Overcome FEAR, Frustration, Anger, Exhaustion and Stress I am making available the entire \"Heroes In Training Program\" FREE online through \"Youtube\" videos.\r\n\r\nAfter interviewing over 40 leaders in internet marketing and copywriting, Napoleon Hill's \"Think and Grow Rich,\" is the one book that was credited the most in helping them achieve success, wealth, happiness and peace. \r\n\r\nNapoleon said that Andrew Carnegie believed that if his secrets were taught in all public schools and colleges that it would so revolutionize the entire educational system that schooling time could be cut in half and people could attain their dreams in a short period of time. \r\n\r\nThe survivors of the Firestorm can definitely benefit from Mr. Carnegie's knowledge, advice and strategies.\r\n\r\nFor this reason I have chosen \"Think and Grow Rich\" as the primary training program for young people in my \"In Search Of Heroes\" program. I have converted the public domain copy into a super-learning format that appeals to both boys and girls. \r\n\r\nAfter reading his original work, I felt it was important to edit his public domain copy so it appealed to boys and girls. The original was apparently written to men specifically. With the huge impact women have on the family and society, there is good reason girls learn the secrets of wealth accumulation also at an early age. \r\n\r\nIf we as a society hope to solve many of the social problems, we will need boys and girls, men and women working together rather than at war with each other. Hopefully, every family and community will watch each section many times and create their own family and community MasterMind group that is such a critical part of Andrew Carnegie's model to transform society by helping every person understand how to overcome problems, mistakes, failures and difficulties and accumulate wealth and achieve their dreams. \r\n\r\nThere are so many people who have lost so much and their lives are devastated. Of all the books I have read, \"Think and Grow Rich\" has many of the solutions and answers Southern California residents need to know.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of wisdom is when each person can discover their own hero in their own minds and integrate their right and left brain hemispheres and female and male natures into a cohesive whole that can accomplish anything a person chooses.\r\n\r\nThink and Grow Rich is the foundation of my \"In Search Of Heroes Program.\" My two granddaughters are staying with us permanently while their mother and father are overcoming the major mistakes many adult-children between the ages 25-35 are currently struggling with. \r\n\r\nI am using my \"Think and Grow Rich\" superlearning program to inspire and educate the parents and granddaughters. They love the superlearning music and the incredible pictures from nature that are the backgrounds for each PowerPoint slide. I believe if we can provide information to young people in a format that appeals to both sides of their brains, they can develop their inherent genius at an early age.\r\n\r\nAndrew Carnegie believed if we teach young people his principles it would radically reduce the time spent in schools by half. The time wasted by not pursuing a specific life goal would be minimized. \r\n\r\nHopefully, moms and dads, especially in single parent homes, can study the teaching of Napoleon Hill and create their own family mastermind group to help solve the problems they are facing together. \r\n\r\nThen extended families can create their mastermind group that eventually expands into small community groups for every business, church and association. I believe if we can work together in a spirit of harmony, we the people can solve our own problems. \r\n\r\nIt is high time fathers, mothers, grandparents, aunts and uncles came to the aid of our children using the \"Think and Grow Rich\" principles to change the world for better. \r\n\r\nYou will see links to the videos of the military, charity, health, teachers, health and business heroes videos. Please pass these on to those who need a little inspiration to achieve their dreams...no matter the obstacles!", "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5z9ho", "name": "t1_c02bpkd", "author_flair_css_class": null}
