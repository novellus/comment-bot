So if anyone can explain to me why BoA has more derivatives risk than the entire economic output of the USA.  Then I just might be able to explain to you how that bank will survive, and how a Fed bailout wouldn't cause a national currency panic.\n\nWhen I see a poor sob go to BoA to open up their retirement account and buy certificates of deposit, I just want to cry.
