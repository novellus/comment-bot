After officials ran his ID through a computer, they asked if he was opposed to the \"ideology of the United States.\" He was detained and questioned by a State Department special agent. During the interrogation, the agent accused Clarke of knowing where Osama Bin Laden was hiding. Clarke was sent home after five hours.\r\n\r\nNow how would an [unemployed Canadian factory worker organizing unions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Clarke_%28activist%29) just happen to know where Osama Bin Laden might be hiding, when the entire efforts of the military and intelligence organizations of several nations could not find him? How patently ridiculous. \r\n\r\nAnd what the hell is the *\"ideology of the United States\"?* Is it whatever Bush's handlers say it is? Is it whatever Paul Wolfowitz says it is? Is it up to the interpretation of whichever Homeland Fear agent happens to be asking the questions?  If you don't support every single idea for every ill concieved war for profit does that make one a traitor? Or is one a traitor if one does go along with the illegalities and immoralities? \r\n\r\nThe US is made up of people with a whole bunch of different and conflicting ideologies. That's one of the things that make us unique.
