Second hand smoke is bad for your health, but will rarely kill anyone immediately.  (Severe asthma I suppose, but probably very rare cases.)  Smoke free establishments already had a market (Tim Horton's had gone smoke free in many locations almost a decade before laws were passed), and as a nonsmoker I benefited from the law, but I do realize that smokers got the short end of the stick...even private clubs like the Legion had to enforce a full smoking ban, which I think probably should have been left up to the groups.\r\n\r\nBut agreed...blanket statements generally suck, and consequences need to be weighed.

your reply.\n\nCorporations are amoral, not immoral.  They care about profit, which seems to be what you believe, and I concur.  The point is that they will do anything that makes them money within the boundaries they have.  The problem with your marketplace, and why I see you as hostile to capitalism, is your blanket assertion that \"For you to think that the market place will take care of itself is a joke.\"  Can you prove that?\n\nEvery economicist (sp?) is proving otherwise daily it seems.\n\nAs for taxes and the selfish argument, don't be silly.  Who are you to decide how I spend my money?  Why is the government the monopoly on services to the poor?\n\nFrankly, the government doing charity work is *absolutely terrifying* to me.  What little chance of instilling charitable values in individuals, so they can donate as they see fit, disappears when they can say \"oh well, the government will take care of them.\"  Check out Europe, it's already happening there.  Government confiscation of your money to \"help\" people goes through the most ludicrous amount of inefficient, wasteful bureaucracy possible and then is months late helping.  Who was down on the site after Katrina first?  it wasn't the government, and it doesn't matter who's in charge.  Government, by definition, cannot be efficient at its current size.\n\nIt's really another example of the name-calling I point out to call me selfish.  I merely want the freedom to give my money to whom I choose, not have it confiscated through force of law to do less good than I can choose to do with it myself.  Of course we need roads and bridges, but the Bridge to Nowhere in Alaska?  Other pet projects by government officials that are named after them, built with my money?  I don't live where they are spending it, and frankly, it won't help 95% of the people in the country.  Is that selfish of the 95%, or the government official and those 5% who think its their right to confiscate our money to buy them something?\n\nIt's all how you look at it, but try to think the other way around, because that's key.\n\nIs it selfish for me to want to spend my money for charity as I choose?  Or is it selfish for Joe Schmo in Alaska to feel entitled to my money to build his pet project?\n\nIt was a good conversation, though, thanks.

He was pointing out that if I have control over 60% of my income, I have more freedom than if I have control over 59%.  He exaggerated the numbers to make the point more clear.  You fixate on the numbers instead of acknowledging the point.\n\nIgnorant is also a name when you label him as such because he disagrees.  He has provided a plethora of facts and examples that prove he isn't ignorant.  You are not ignorant either obviously because of your facts and examples.  Ignorant is a name in this instance.\n\nI of course read your comment about \"paying taxes gives you freedom.\"  That comment (not you) is silly.

You'll begin to be able to predict, with some consistency, exactly what kind of response the most upvoted comment will be. Nearly everyone here, myself probably included, writes in the same mold of rhetoric. Due to the censorship of comments after -5 votes, people rarely make controversial comments, and the ones that do are usually swarmed with opponents, so most choose to conform to what redditors like to read. \n\nLook at websites like Somethingawful or Slashdot. The userbase on reddit isn't necessarily more intelligent than the userbase on those sites, and they have a completely different style of rhetoric than reddit does. Imagine copying word-for-word successful responses from either of those sites on here--they would quickly be downvoted to -15 or lower. The amount of rhetorical homogeneity on this site is worse than 4chan, and it's probably due in part to how posting something vastly out of line with the majority on this site will cause a volley of smug, indignant ridicule and downvotes to rain upon your account. I hate to say it, but the amount of conformity on this site makes me miss trolls sometimes.     ", "author_flair_css_class": null}
