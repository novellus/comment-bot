You know, that place where stuff actually *happens* instead of just being written about by hyperactive paranoids.\r\n\r\nMy friends and I are poor by any government standard, yet we own a house and have miniscule property taxes.  Even if we didn't pay for awhile, it would take years before the cost of trying to seize our property and resell it would be worth more than the cost of our tax bill.  (which, honestly, we could pay by having a frigging *bake sale* if it came down to it)\r\n\r\nAnd furthermore, what do the property taxes pay for?  Our firetrucks.  Our roads.  Our police cars.  All the services that we, as homeowners with a city's limits, make use of or could have need of every day.  Why the hell would I bitch and whine about *gasp* having to PAY for such services.\r\n\r\nWhat's the alternative?  Being a freeloader?  Using the city's streets and police and garbage service and more, not pay a cent, and then get upset when the city wants something in return?\r\n\r\nYeah, *that* sounds rational. \r\n\r\nAnd finally, if you think our country is so sarcastically \"great\" - GO ELSEWHERE.  Go find your libertarian paradise where there are no property taxes.  Or hell, go *found* your glorious land of freedom where everyone only pays for police and fire services if they feel like doing so.  All you need is an island. But if you think you're going to change anything locally by saying \"Whaaaa, the government won't give me fire protection for free!\" you really *are* delusional.

There is nowhere you can go, however remote, to escape it.\n\n\nYou can live at the top of a mountain, and never have human contact for the rest of your life, but as soon as you fail to pay taxes, they take everything away. Is it right that you can provide yourself on your own land, but that it can be taken away because you don't have  cash income?  It effectively makes it illegal for those without an income to own property.  \n\nIf some politician tried to pass an actual law that stated in unambiguous terms that it was illegal for the poor to own property, he'd be swarmed on by every left wing liberal activist in the country, yet that's just what the property tax system does, makes it illegal for the poor to own property because if they buy it and then can't pay the taxes, it gets taken away.  What's even worse, is they don't even bother to force a sale anymore. It used to be that an officer of the court would administer the sale of the property, the taxes would go to the government, and the homeowner would get the difference. Now, they just sell the title to the property outright for the amount of the taxes and you get nothing. They will take a $400,000 home that may have been in a family for generations, and sell it for $5000 in back taxes and evict the owner without even the means to buy a less expensive house somewhere else without guilt or remorse. Without the right to absolute ownership of property, you have no rights at all. Just because you pay your taxes now, does not mean that you are free. They will come and take your property just like anyone else's as soon as you stop paying. You are as much a slave to the system as the rest of us, you just don't see it.
