The best I've read about it is [here](http://www.abc.net.au/rn/healthreport/stories/2007/1969924.htm#transcript)\n\n&gt; Robert Lustig: Exactly, in fact exercise is the best treatment. The question is why does exercise work in obesity? Because it burns calories? That's ridiculous. Twenty minutes of jogging is one chocolate chip cookie, I mean you can't do it. One Big Mac requires three hours of vigorous exercise to work that off, that's not the reason that exercise is important, exercise is important for three reasons exclusive of the fact that it burns calories.\n\n&gt; The first is it increases skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity, in other words it makes your muscle more insulin sensitive, therefore your pancreas can make less, therefore your levels can drop, therefore there's less insulin in your blood to shunt sugar to fat. That's probably the main reason that exercise is important and I'm totally for it.\n\n&gt; The second reason that exercise is important is because it's the single best treatment to get your cortisol down. Cortisol is your stress hormone, it's the hormone that goes up when you are mega-stressed, it's the hormone that basically causes visceral fat deposition which is the bad fat and it has been tied to the metabolic syndrome. So by getting your cortisol down you're actually reducing the amount of fat deposited and it also reduces food intake. People think that somehow exercise increases food intake, it does not, it reduces food intake.\n\n&gt; And then the third reason that exercise is important, which is somewhat not well known, but I'm trying to evaluate this at the present time, is that it actually helps detoxify the sugar fructose.

Of course, she didn't have a basis for saying that exercise was the cure(she did) just like this article has no basis for saying diet is the cure(it does).\n\nTaken together, it basically tells us what we already know - that for the great majority of the population, diet and exercise does not produce sizable weight loss in the long term.  That's not to say there aren't other health effects.  And to all those who will say \"Hey, but I did exercise plan a, b or c and I lost weight\" I'm going to say 3 things:\n1) You haven't waited long enough for the weight to creep back.\n2) You're a statistical outlier(diet &amp; exercise *does* work for slightly less than 1/3rd of people who try it...)\n3) You're a naturally thin person who somehow gained a lot of weight by not taking care of yourself, and the second you started, the weight came off.  This might also put you in 2.
