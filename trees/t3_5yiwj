If I were optimistic, I would say that when he said \"We've got a leader in Iran who has announced that he wants to destroy Israel, so if you're interested in avoiding World War III, it seems like you ought to be interested in preventing them from having the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon\", what he wreally was announcing to the world that the US would exhaust all possible means of preventing it short of war before applying the military option. But I don't know if I have that kind of optimism left in me. The world is a pretty fucked up place -- but most people in it are pretty decent -- but the bloated rats we've let float up to the surface in our political and economic leaderships will do anything to hang on to their privilege. And that's what's going on here. That's wha the Bush-Gore families are. Going from under-privileged to privileged is still possible in the USA. That's not what is at issue here. And I'm not arguing that everything the privileged do is bad and I don't believe that we should ban wealth and the lawful accumulation of riches. I will however argue that the social damage done by the whole dynamic around those 2% is killing this country. I know I'll sound like an old fart for saying this, but I think the whole obsession with the paparazzi/reality-show in the United States and in Britain and increasingly everywhere else is a drain on our economy, on our intellectual and scientific life, and on our collective ability to think clearly.", "author": "ebrunar", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c029snr", "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "name": "t1_c029snr", "parent_id": "t3_5yiwj", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}
