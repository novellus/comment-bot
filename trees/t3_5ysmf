As a man of some fifty-seven years\nof age, I am discovered sucking the penis of a baby boy. I ask you to\npicture your own outrage and revulsion. Ah, but I have my explanation\nall ready. I am a mohel: an appointed circumciser and foreskin\nremover. My authority comes from an ancient text, which commands\nme to take a baby boy's penis in my hand, cut around the prepuce,\nand complete the action by taking his penis in my mouth, sucking\noff the foreskin, and spitting out the amputated flap along with a\nmouthful of blood and saliva. This practice has been abandoned by\nmost Jews, either because of its unhygienic nature or its disturbing\nassociations, but it still persists among the sort of Hasidic fundamentalists\nwho hope for the Second Temple to be rebuilt in Jerusalem. To\nthem, the primitive rite of the peri'ah metsitsah is part of the original\nand unbreakable covenant with god. In New York City in the year\n2005, the ritual, as performed by a fifty-seven-year-old mohel, was\nfound to have given genital herpes to several small boys, and to have\ncaused the deaths of at least two of them. In normal circumstances,\nthe disclosure would have led the public health department to forbid\nthe practice and the mayor to denounce it. But in the capital of the\nmodern world, in the first decade of the twenty-first century, such\nwas not the case. Instead, Mayor Bloomberg overrode the reports by\ndistinguished Jewish physicians who had warned of the danger of the\ncustom, and told his health care bureaucracy to postpone any verdict.\nThe crucial thing, he said, was to be sure that the free exercise of religion\nwas not being infringed. In a public debate with Peter Steinfels,\nthe liberal Catholic \"religion editor\" of the New York Times, I was told\nthe same thing \n\n\n\nIts hard to believe that this would be happening in New York!
