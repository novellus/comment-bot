Right-wingers believe that corporations can run things better than the government can. That is essentially what their entire economic platform is built on. They refuse to provide universal health care because they believe that corporations will take care of them. They hate taxes because they would much rather pay corporations for services than they would the government. They believe the corporations are trust-worthy entities that only have the people's best interests at heart, because they believe that if a corporation violates a person's trust the market will punish them. Unfortunately however, the facts show a very different scenario in which corporations profit from screwing people over.\n\nI'm called a rightwinger over on Dailykos, and I believe none of these things.\n\nWhen I envision a free market, I envision actors that are actual citizens. Perhaps there business is incorporated in the technical sense, but always as partnerships or sole proprietorships... never as corporations with boards of directors and shares and all that bullshit.\n\nSuch corporations as those, they may be convenient, but they're also very dangerous. They can be relied on for little, and even less unless they are properly restrained.\n\nLibertarianism gets corporations confused with people, but then doesn't everyone? A corporation does not deserve free speech, or even the right to exist, unless we grant it that on a temporary basis.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02c09k", "parent_id": "t3_5zdht", "id": "c02c09k", "author_flair_css_class": null}
