They say however the lack of natural fire (or their long time policy of extinguishing natural fires) is only part of the reason there is such a build up of dry foliage.  Global warming (according to the segment) is certainly helping by making things drier, and extending the fire season in the high mountains.  Things may be much worse than we thought, one scientist interviewed believes as much as a quarter to half of the west's forests will disappear because of fire in the next 100 years.
