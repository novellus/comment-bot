A second series of studies was conducted with cigarettes containing 3%, 4% and 5% HFCS including MS chemistry, Ames assay, SCE assay in CHO cells, and a neutral red cytotoxicity assays. Collectively, mainstream smoke chemistry, genotoxicity, dermal tumor-promotion, and inhalation toxicity studies demonstrated no differences between cigarettes with 3% HFCS and cigarettes with 3% previous termcorn syrup/next terminvert sugar. Also, mainstream smoke chemistry and genotoxicity of cigarettes with 4% and 5% HFCS were not different from cigarettes with 3% HFCS.
