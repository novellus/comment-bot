Find what characterizes any difference between the way the two groups talk. Once you've got a hypothesis, do it again with 2 more groups, and test for that specific hypothesis (word abstraction, say). \n\nI've heard this idea said a slightly different way, in some interior decoration context, or some writer - that high ceilings give you a greater sense of possibility. It seems magical, but, it doesn't have to - the Situationists used to talk about walking through different parts of town, noticing the way different buildings / environments made them feel ('psycho-geographics'). I can imagine noticing that, too, so a 'high ceiling' effect seems plausible. Plus, I experienced it in an old apartment once.
