The issue is whether redefining marriage to include homosexuals makes it more likely that marriage would be redefined to include, say, a person and a goat.\n\nDude, \"that marriage would be redefined to include, say, a person and a goat\" is part of what was meant by \"in other ways\".  You either cannot read or you have a massive brain injury.  There could not possibly be a more simple concept to understand.  There are simply no words to express what a dumbass you are to *still* not grasp that concept.  You are as dumb as a post.\n\n&gt; Again, as I argued earlier (an argument you predictably ignored), the overall trend of changes to the definition of marriage, including extending it to homosexuals, makes the possibility of it being changed to include a person and a goat less likely.\n\nI didn't ignore you at all.  I addressed your point directly:\n\n&gt; Redefining marriage to include homosexuals obviously makes it more likely that marriage would be redefined in other ways. Your position is patently absurd.\n\n-\n\n&gt; I call you homophobic because you have an irrational fear of homosexuals.\n\nFalse.  I have no fear whatsoever of homosexuals.  Are you talking out your ass again or can you prove that claim?\n\n&gt; What am I propagandizing, exactly?\n\nYou are saying that people who disapprove of homosexuality do so on the basis of fear.  You know that you cannot defend that position yet you continue to make it hoping that somebody would be stupid enough to believe that you have a clue.  You are a dolt.

Let me know if I'm going too fast.\n\n**Proposition 6:** Redefining marriage to include two agents of the same sex is based on the idea that the two agents are both adults who can give consent. Therefore:\n\n**Proposition 7:** Same sex marriage is consistent with the incremental changes in marriage up to this point. However:\n\n**Proposition 8:** Since a person can give consent and a goat cannot, a relationship bewteen a person and a goat must be either a possession or a guardianship. Therefore:\n\n**Proposition 9:** Because extending marriage to a person and a goat goes *against* the trend that the definition of marriage has followed, and to the extent that defining marriage to include adults of the same sex is consistent with this trend, then defining marriage to include adults of the same sex makes it *less likely* that future redefinitions of marriage will include a person and a goat.\n\nPlease feel free to go back and re-read any parts that might have given you trouble.
