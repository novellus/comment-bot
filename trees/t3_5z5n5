Zodiac symbolism is everywhere. I definately think it has an influence, but I'm not convinced as some are that it explains the whole story. Like the idea that all the spiritual traditions, in thier bewildering intricacy, are mere allegories for the movement of the Zodiac concoced by human imagination. From what I've seen, that's far too simplistic to account for everything involved. \r\n\r\nOur contemporary understanding of the Zodiac, and what it meant to pre-modern peoples, is sadly rather minescule. Modern western astrology as we know it today is very much the product of an attempted reconstruction from incomplete fragments of the traditional data, which began in the 18th Century. In effect, what we have in modern astrology is more or less a shadow of traditional astrology because the chain of its transmission (as an oral teaching) was broken. Guenon refers to this situation in his work, and I saw it echoed in a recent essay by one of the eminent modern astrologers.\r\n\r\nAnyway, there are many who've suggested, rather intelligently I think, that the whole system of symbols based on the movement of the Zodiac, as well as the physical movement of the constellations themselves, is actually in itself a symbol of metaphsical principles. *Metaphysical* here used in its original etymological sense as pertaining to something *beyond physical manifestation*. The implication being that there are levels of reality and influential principles beyond the routinely observable world, which affect our existence whether or not we pay attention to them. And that is really the whole premise of spirituality. \r\n\r\nOne of the traditional ideas that died after the Middle Ages was the one that concieved of the human being as a microcosm, which analogically mirrors the macrocosm. There's an analogy that I like to keep in mind when I think about the nature of astrology. It is this: In the act of moving my arm, the center of my consciousness is sending a message/signal through billions of individual cells to align in a coordinated way that effects the movement. There is a hierarchy of systems that all align in the trasmission of that message. Transposed to the cosmic environment, the movement of stars could be seen as kind of cosmic nervous system that recieves and transmits impulses from a transcendent Principle. And as such, humans would be like cells in a greater being. \r\n\r\nBut I digress... With your background, I think that you're well prepared to consider what Guenon had to say, and will probably find it quite fascinating. Wish you the best, man. It's a wild time to be alive.

Fortunately, I found a used copy cheap. Thanks.\n\nI did some (little) study of comparative religions, after rejecting Xtianity. It took me years to begin to realize that at the heart of most of the world's major religions is some version of conceptualization of the world in Astrological Ages. Now, before going any further, let me state plainly that I'm not at all talking that nonsense in the tabloid papers or that jive superficial stuff most are familiar with. And I also have to add that being somewhat schooled in Astronomy, I was not at all prepared to even have an open mind about Astrology ... originally.\n\nYet the more I learned about the history of Astronomy, the more I bumped into Astrology. And the more I learned about the history of various religions, the more I bumped into Astrology. Now, I'm **not** saying I believe in any of this other than in connecting the historical linkages.\n\nHindus are upfront about the Vedic arts and their role in that belief system. In early Islam the word for astronomy is the same as the word for astrology. Then, there's the Druids and Celtic astrology. Tibetan astrology draws from Indian, Chinese and the Buddhist Kalachakra tantra. \n\nChristianity seems to be the most confused on it's astrological connections. Some denounce the mere concept as the occult or the \"dark arts\", whereas some others are open to discussing the Old Testament as the age of the Ram (symbol of Judaism) and the New Testament as the beginning of the Age of Pisces the fish and sign of a religious times. I've also seen a presentation interpreting the books of New Testament in terms of the signs of the Zodiac. Oddly enough that was at an Astronomy convention where 90% of attendees openly dismissed both religion and astrology. And finally, I've seen a presentation interpreting the book of Revelation as discussing the change from the Age of Pisces to the Age of Aquarius.\n\nNow, again, I'm not saying what I, personally, make of all this, because honestly I just don't know. But, seeing such ancient connections running as common threads through so many belief systems does make me wonder where it all started and why. \n\nSuperstitions or a way of figuring out why our leaders act the way they do?

It is truly chilling stuff. \r\n\r\nFor my part, I was never indoctrinated in Christianity or told anything about spiritual things when I was child. My parents were/are a gullible kind of New Age dupes, who go through would-be \"get rich\" gurus like fashion trends. After a regreattable cultish commune episode with my older siblings, the folks decided not to press any kind of spiritual stuff on me and my younger brothers, thank God. \r\n\r\nI started doing a comparative study of world spiritual traditions and mythology of my own volition when I was about 16, which has brought to an uncommon perspective. And ever since I had that experience of correspondance between Revelation and CNBC, I've been looking very closely at the various traditions of eschatology (fancy catagory word for ideas/visions about the end of the world). There are some uncanny correspondances in other of these traditions as well. \r\n\r\nThe Hindu perspective sees the world successively descending in a series of Ages, each darker than the next, until at the last pass of the last Age (Kali-Yuga) everything breaks down in chaos and confusion, while everyone is estranged from the Principle of thier existence (the Absolute, God, or whatever name one might give It). In that vision, the end is actually followed by a restoration of the primordial state, as a new cycle begins with another Golden Age. Another one, with the same basic motif of annihilation and restoration in a new Aeon is found in the Norse mythology of Ragnar\u00f6k. But more similar than both of these to Revelation is the vision of apocalypse in Islam. Muhammad's vision, and the religion that sprung from it, is apocalyptic at its very foundation. And to be perfectly honest, a lot of what he said concerning the signs that would presage the Hour (of apocalypse) are extremely uncanny in the present context. Just a few: \r\n\r\n*\"The barefoot, the naked, the destitue, and the shepards will compete in the construction of tall buildings.\"*\r\n\r\ncompare Revelation 3:17 -\r\n\r\n*\"For you say, I am rich, I have prospered, and I need nothng; not knowing that you are wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked.\"*\r\n\r\nThis one is also striking given the exponential curve of techonological innovation: \r\n\r\n*\"Time will be shortened so that a year will be like a month, a month like a day, a day like an hour.\"* \r\n\r\nMuhammad also said this concerning the Hour:\r\n\r\n*\"No time will come to you which will not be followed by one that is more evil until you encounter your Lord.\"*\r\n                   \r\nI'm only beginning to look at these things in depth, and the picture it paints is that no matter what is **really** going on (I don't claim to know) we are living in a very bizzare and momentous time, of a magnitude that easily boggles the mind. Or at least that's what I find.   \r\n\r\nIn any case, if you're interested in exploring this kind of thing further, I highly recommend a book called \"The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times\" by Rene Guenon.

More importantly, the Jews see themselves as a victimized people, the problem being that they are historically completely right, so their belief system has an empirical validity for its adherents.  This is a form of religious fanaticism just like Christianity and Islam, but it is never treated as such because of its historical justification.  Do you realize how fucked up it is that Norman Finkelstein was denied tenure in America?  It is reminiscent of Galileo's trial and no event I can think of in the modern, industrialized West.  The universities are the last bastions of free speech, I thought.\n\nI admit this is all self-indulgent but I want to hear what others think.  The central thrust of my argument is this: main putative causes of wars in the ME are oil, Israel, and spreading democracy.  The 3rd is patently false.  The 1st is probably true but can be resolved through democratic processes, and there is historical precedent for reducing corporate power.  The 2nd is extremely pernicious: if prominent Jews are taught from a very young age (I am realizing how psychologically powerful such ideas are) to see themselves as a historically victimized people and that their enemies are currently near at hand, there will be no restraint on the Israel occupation whatsoever, nor on any of its enemies -- Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, etc.  The victim is given carte blanche.  As a result, the Muslim world is a powder keg waiting to explode upon our continuing attacks on more and more prominent targets.  Never mind the religiosity of the Middle East and (over the longer-term) extremely high birth rates.  The only way I see out is Jews abandoning their victim status or Muslims practicing pacifism and voluntarily retreating from the occupied territories, both of which are about as likely to happen as pigs flying.

I believe there are three levels to this realization process.\n\nThe first level is complete ignorance. Mainstream America is just too fucking stupid to hold a decent conversation.\n\nThe submitter, and most of you, are in the second stage.  You're well aware of the current situation, you can point out everything that's going wrong, and you're angry.  Like frogster, these people believe that the evidence points to ACTUALLY falling into a totalitarian state.\n\nThe third stage actually moves closer to the first one, not further away.  Here, you realize that things certainly look bad, but in all actuality life is pretty good.  Yeah some people have it better and worse than others, but thats normal.  You realize that you still have friends and family, you always have food on your plate, and you have a very decent life.  And although it may look like evil is descending upon us, this stage recognizes that 1984 is just a book, and will not become a reality.\n\nTo explain a little further: Everyone cries about warrentless spying.  But do you REALLY think the government is listening to you talk about when you're coming home from work?  When was the last time your friend was arrested because the government illegally heard him talking about smoking a joint?  Another example is police brutality.  Admist hundreds of thousands of interactions a day, most of you have probably never and will never be beaten and tazered while trying to protect your rights.\n\nThe third stage understands how people could draw the conclusions that we are all screwed, but that the REALITY is that, while our rights and our government experience small variations over time, the true totalitarian state will never come to fruitation.\n\n\nI myself tend to sway between the second and third stage, so its not a concrete \"you all are idiots for thinking XX\" type of thing. \n\n*edit* to-&gt;too error :(", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "parent_id": "t3_5z5n5", "id": "c02bhex", "author_flair_css_class": null}
