Seeing as how he was pretty pissed at this whole ordeal, he walked out of the store and hoped to come later.\n\nBut he was ridiculously pissed at this accusations, and after walking about a couple dozen steps outside, he walked back into the store.

Workers asked if he needed anything, and he told them that he was waiting for the manager. \n\nSome of the workers were yelling at him to get the hell out, but he stood his ground. Eventually they called security, but he said he wouldn't leave until he got his money back or at the very least, spoke with the manager. He was pretty calm in all of this, not yelling but speaking in a casual tone. \n\nFinally, they brought the manager out to speak privately with him.
