War is expensive, and there's usually a cheaper way to get what you want. For example, in North Korea we keep them from starving; in India and Pakistan we basically cross our fingers.\n\nOnce again you sir are a moron. The war is most certainly about oil and control of the global economy. It's that simple.\n\n&gt;All this doesn't seem relevant to the question of the right thing to do in Iran -- after all, it doesn't take much intelligence to be consistent. But that only makes sense if the rule you're being consistent with is useful (and universally applicable).\n\nOf course, this is relevant to the topic of a war with Iran. It's very simple. Oil lubricates and fuels the beast. He who controls the buying and selling of oil through monetary means rules the world.\n\n&gt;Let's do an experiment: you think of the money you pay for groceries in yen (so when you're at the grocery store, you convert prices to yen, and add up the yen prices), and when you get to the checkout, you convert that added-up yen value into US dollars, which you give to the clerk in exchange for your groceries. How does this affect the USD/JPY exchange rate? Even if your grocery store charged you yen, and you paid in yen, it wouldn't have any effect, because they'd still convert to local currencies to spend their money, which they already do. The only real change is the commission, which is minimal. \n\nFirst and for most, we are not discussing the valuation of oil in US dollars but the need to have US dollars to purchase oil in the first place. You sir should learn to read the links that people submit to you for verification of a point. Currently, if you wish to purchase oil from the Middle East you must come to America and buy dollars from us with whatever resource you have available (we prefer gold, but barring that you can send us goods and services), then and only then can you go to the Middle Eastern countries and purchase oil in US dollars. Thus Japan, China, India, and Europe are all willing to take on trillions of dollars of debt from America, because that guarantees them future oil supplies. It's about oil trade. Pure and simple. \n\n&gt;We started talking about currencies after you brought up the nationality issue. Are you confused, or a liar?\n\nI started talking about currencies, because you failed to read my link and grasp the concept that you must hold US dollars to buy oil on the open market today. The whole Food for Oil scandal in the UN had nothing to do with trading oil for food. It had to do with Saddam agreeing to accept euros in payment for oil. Which is a direct threat to American Empire's global economy, thus the bombing and invasion. As of last month, Iran is doing the same thing by forcing Japan to purchase oil in euros and yen. Therefore, Iran has become a direct threat to American global interest, namely the interest to keep all oil trade flowing through the Federal Reserve Bank.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "politics", "ups": 0, "name": "t1_c02cfna", "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5zfve", "retrieved_on": 1427424856, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02cfna", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02ceze", "body": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "politics", "name": "t1_c02ceze", "ups": 1, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5zfve", "retrieved_on": 1427424865, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02ceze", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02cer0", "body": "&gt;Iran's leaders have also been talking about nuclear proliferation.
