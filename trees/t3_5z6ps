The Senate passed a seven-year extension of the Internet tax moratorium, with robust language that should stiff-arm even the most voracious state and local governments looking for loopholes to tax your email.\n\nMr. McConnell created negotiating leverage by forcing on to the Senate schedule a vote on Mr. Sununu's permanent Net tax ban. The last thing moratorium opponents wanted was to face an up-or-down vote on a permanent ban, which is why they recently cancelled a committee vote when it became clear they had underestimated the popularity of the tax moratorium. ...\n\nWhile accepting less than a permanent ban, Mr. Sununu and his pro-Internet allies won additional provisions authored by Mr. Wyden to protect consumers. A report yesterday from the Congressional Research Service revealed that the House had botched the drafting of its four-year extension by leaving open the possibility of new taxes on email services if they weren't marketed along with Internet access service. Kudos to Senators Sununu, McConnell and Wyden.", "author": "NRSC", "created_utc": "1193414701", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "archived": true, "id": "c02bhod", "subreddit": "politics", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5z6ps", "name": "t1_c02bhod", "author_flair_css_class": null}
