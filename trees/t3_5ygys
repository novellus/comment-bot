Ignore all the whiners who didn't know how to treat the bartendress and get free beer.\n\nIt was a great turnout, 200+ people in a space intended for about 100.  I tried to hold a bar spot, but it became untenable.  Thx guys for bringing me da beers.\n\nFirst, let me compliment spez.  He had to suffer thru those ass kissers, but when I pulled him to our table, he was gracious and engaged with a bunch of folks who had no clue who he was.  It's nice to see a 20-something success story who isn't insuferable already.\n\nFor kn0thing, he was wearing a t-shirt \"I broke Reddit\".  We were going to take him out back and beat him up, but then we worried what the downtime would be and moved on.\n\nThe other guys, they must have been up front, and there was no way to get to them.\n\nLooking forward to next year.", "author": "srv", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5ygys", "id": "c029m2y", "author_flair_css_class": null}
