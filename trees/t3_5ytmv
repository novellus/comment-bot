They have different lifestyles, cultures, problems, they occupy different geographical landscapes. Why is there this expectation that they would or should see eye to eye on anything but the really big all-encompassing issues?\r\n\r\nThe main issue that I see here is that most people think that everybody in the U.S. ought to live under one set of rules. This sounds good, and fair, and just, until you realize that the rules are so much more than just the big ones about killing and stealing and holding to your contracts.\r\nThey're speed limits and firearms regulations and smoking bans and pet ID tags and taxes and vehicle stickers. They're curfews for teenagers and drug policy. \r\n\r\nWhy people want to centralize government is beyond me.
