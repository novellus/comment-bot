Of these, most economists (who are generally the people who get elected to the run the Fed) regard it as most important to keep prices stable.  Part of the reason it's independent, is that keeping prices stable almost always comes at the expense of jobs (at least in the short term).  Obviously an elected body would find it difficult to act in a way that decreased employment, even if that was the correct course of action.\n  \n------\n\nI think a 14% increase per year for the last 14 years is probably too high (though I don't have enough data to be sure).  An unwillingness to raise rates (lowering money supply) certainly contributed to the dotcom and then the housing bubble.  \n\nHowever, the money supply should always increase at a greater rate than GDP. This is because it must take into account the growth of GDP as well as expected inflation.  Expected inflation is the reason most workers get raises every year, even though their productivity doesn't suddenly increase in January.\n\n------\n\nThe fed didn't stop publishing M3 data because it was trying to hide anything (as evidence from the fact that it's pretty easily found elsewhere), rather it felt that the narrower M2 measure was a good enough indicator of the direction of money supply.  \nThe fed also doesn't concentrate as much on money supply as it used to.  That's because monetarism has lost favor among economists and the Fed doesn't in the end have complete control over the amount of money in circulation (mainly because foreigners can lend to Americans).  Instead the Fed concentrates on inflation.\n\n------\n\nHousing does have value because people need a place to live.  All houses and property earn rent.  Even if you own and live in your house and don't actually pay rent to yourself, the rent still exists as saved cost.  Housing is often overvalued and doesn't earn as well as other assets because there are very low barriers to entry.   \n\nI don't think your statement about the teenage couple has much merit.

The M3 is increasing by 14% per year, it's been going up for the last 14 years.  is the economy increasing by 14% per year?  In fact, it got so bad that they stopped publishing the M3, so people had rebuild it using source data.  How much you want to bet that most of that money is going toward the purchase of govt bonds, that in turn finance government spending and wars.  And after all those years of expansion, is our economy ready to boom?  Nope.  It's ready to collapse under too much debt and inflation.\n\nHousing is a classic example of the Fed gone wrong.  The bubble in housing was directly proportional to the willingness of the banking system to lend into it, and that was led on by the unlimited amount of available credit, courtesy of the Fed.  In fact, a house is not a rational \"investment\" almost ever.  It doesn't create productivity or infrastructure.  It is consumption.  It only appeared to be rational because prices (valuations) are always going up, and prices were always going up because of .... Inflation!
