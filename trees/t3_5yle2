From posts I've been reading elsewhere, the [Rubinius project](http://rubini.us/) has been using this style of test writing to generate a [specification for Ruby](http://rubini.us/pages/specs-overview). \n\nAs for the DSL/Syntax thing: if the developers need to write a *lot* of this code because there currently aren't good specs and test cases for Ruby, then maybe even modest gains (e.g. the assert v should) might save a good deal of work. It doesn't look like groundbreaking work... may not have been worth the invention of a new [TLA](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/T/TLA.html), but it still looks kind of nifty.
