I remember delivering to some midnight bike race at Rice where I was basically mugged for my pizzas by a mob, only to have some douche throw money (barely covering the actual bill) at me as I was leaving to call the cops. \n\nWe didn't dose just any customer with weed; just the asshole cops who would laugh as they handed us our ticket, and laugh again when they came by to pick up their free pizzas. The store was inside of a town within Houston called \"West University\", and like many small towns, they make most of their revenue by giving **massive** amounts of undeserved traffic tickets that could NEVER be beaten in their courts.\n\nWe didn't shake up everyone's drinks. I got no-tipped a lot when I delivered to the nearby hospitals (who also got free drinks and discounted pizzas), but they didn't treat delivery drivers like some animal to be taunted. When you deliver pizza, you know you aren't going to get a tip every time. Maybe the next house will over-tip. Maybe you'll deliver to a stripper who will answer the door naked. Maybe you'll meet an old high school girlfriend you lost touch with who tells you to come back by after your shift. It balances out, to some degree.\n\nLater, when I worked for a pizza place that took credit cards, we had a regular customer who was just a HUGE dick. So we waited until Thanksgiving, and used his credit card number to hire a number of tranny escorts to come over during dinner. A bunch of us sat down the street and watched. Wonderful.\n\nI appreciate what you are trying to say, and you have some interesting points; but from what you've said, I can't honestly believe you've ever worked a name tag/minimum wage job. Or if you did, I'd wager you were management.

Work is not compulsory, you are entering into an agreement where you will perform certain tasks for someone in exchange for reimbursement.\n\nA pizza delivery man or waitress is essentially saying \"I'll take minimum wage (or below in some places)\".   Sure, they may get extra money, but they're not getting it from the employer.   You are absorbing all of the risk of the employer having a bad night, and in addition are allowing him to advertise lower prices (since your \"tip\" isn't actually payment).\n\nTips are voluntary.  You can't take someone to a collections agency for not tipping you well.  So you should not take a job where you would be devastated if you received no tips.\n\nPersonally, when I'm in the US I tip well, but the system is completely ridiculous.  I see post after post of people complaining that people don't tip well, or that they stay too long, or that they don't understand why their pizza was late.  These are things that the business should be dealing with, not relationship issues between the employee and the customer.\n\nSo yeah, if you're getting shitty tips, you should quit your shitty job and not jiz in someone's food, or hand them exploding cokes.   You can argue that they deserve it for not tipping you well, but I'd argue that the type of guy who bitches and hands people exploding cokes isn't likely to be someone who (in their other delivery related tasks) is deserving of a gigantic tip.
