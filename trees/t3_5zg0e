As it stands, cell phones are no more designed for kids than cars or credit cards.  \n\nWhat it sounds like is some people want to give kids all of the access and none of the responsibility of a cell phone.  \n\nThe world isn't kid-proof.

Or $10k worth?  \n\nWhat you have given me is a successful example of parenting.  And you also do not have a $10k bill.  Since you said Kids, I assume you have at least 2 kids using data plans on their cells.  So you are dealing with 2x as many kids, and still, no $10k bill.

Again, not because of what I've experienced as a parent - but because of what you've said.\r\n\r\nAnd, since I'm asking you to disclose, I will disclose as well.  My kid is four months old - he doesn't have a cell phone yet.\r\n\r\n&gt;The whole Individual Human Being bit is a true... insofar as you allow it.\r\n\r\nIt is allowed PRETTY far.  Not as far as my Libertarian beliefs would go, but pretty far.\r\n\r\n&gt;Your argument is comparable to this: father buys kid a car at 16. Kid drives car into tree. Father sues car company for not having automatic tree-aversion controls.\r\n\r\nUmm, no.  You forgot to mention that this analogous tree was enticing the kid to hit it with shady advertising that did not disclose the true nature of what would happen if the kid hit the tree.  You are also forgetting that in this strange analogy, the man would have paid for a car that was SUPPOSED TO BE able to hit trees without harm (unlimited texting) and this tree was a \"special tree\" that the car couldn't hit without being harmed.  Also, you are leaving out that the car hit the tree NUMEROUS times but (I don't even know how to compare this part) the car company didn't tell him until the car had hit the tree hundreds, maybe thousands of times.\r\n\r\nThat's without getting deep into it.  Suffice it to say, that isn't really a good analogy to this situation.\r\n\r\n&gt;Allow me to clarify the story a bit: Parent gives child responsibility. Child screws up. Parent feels that service provider is to blame.\r\n\r\nAgain, you conveniently leave out the part where the parent made a good faith effort to purchase a plan that would make it safe for the kid to use a cell phone.  He purchased an unlimted texting plan that he thought would protect his daughter from any texting charges.  He KNEW she liked to text and he made provisions to allow her to text.  Sprint did not behave in a way that people reasonably expect a large, publicly traded, supposedly legitimate corporation would behave.\r\n\r\nRegardless of your beliefs on the technicalities here, Sprint is a poor wireless provider if they don't have basic fraud prevention programs in place.  Any wireless company that would allow $10k in text messages over a month's time WITHOUT making a good effort to get in touch with the customer, or cutting off their service - is a BAD COMPANY.  Try that crap with your home phone.\r\n\r\nI did it in college.  I had a girlfriend back in FL and I was in TN.  This was back when long distance was $0.33 a minute.  My long distance got shut off at $100 until I paid that $100.  (I had it, but I didn't expect to have to pay until the monthly bill came.)  That is what most of us have come to expect from responsible companies.\r\n\r\n&gt;If the child is incapable of handling the responsibility, the parent should not give it to them. If they weren't sure and the kid screws up, it's a Live'n'learn situation.\r\n\r\nThe father clearly took pains to try and make sure the daughter could text all she wanted to without incurring extra charges.\r\n\r\nDo you REALLY think this is reasonable behavior?  Do you REALLY think that every contract we sign with every company we deal with should be \"buyer beware because this company will screw you over in a second if you don't read every last letter of the fine print?\"  Do you conduct business this way?\r\n\r\n&gt;Now as for the Shady Companies taking advantage of the Poor Unfortunate Disabled Woman... that doesn't fly.\r\n\r\nI guess you DO your business that way.  I suppose you believe SPAM is reasonable as well?\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt;Now, as for your Credit Card Company, that's great. Nice of them to call you. Question: if your electricity bill doubles or triples this month, will your electric company call you part way through the month to warn you? What about heating (assuming you use natural gas or some other city provided heat source)? What about water usage? No? Strange, your credit card company does. \r\n\r\nActually, YES. There certainly have been instances where water companies have discovered a broken pipe in a customer's home because they noticed the water usage skyrocket - particularly in the case of \"summer homes\" or \"part-of-the-year\" homes.  It is good business practice.\r\n\r\n&gt;Realize for a moment, your CC company is the Exception. Most services do not do this.\r\n\r\nThis will change.  It is a relatively new item, but I will bet you that in a few years there will be legislation that will wipe this crap out and the whole scam \"premium text messaging industry\" will walk off with their money and go find another way to rip people off until they are rousted away from that scam.\r\n\r\nhttp://redtape.msnbc.com/2007/02/premium_text_me.html\r\n\r\n&gt;This is why I said, it would have been ~nice~ for them to contact the bill payer. That'd be swell. However, it is not an obligation.\r\n\r\nIt might not be a legal obligation, but publicly owned companies are expected to follow a certain ethical standard as well.  Perhaps he should buy a share of stock and go to the next stockholder's meeting and bring it up...\r\n\r\n&gt;If you sued, you'd walk away with the full $10k bill. At least the company was nice enough to drop it to $5k.\r\n\r\nYeah, that was real nice of them.  I'm pretty sure my $75 a month will never go to a company that practices that kind of behavior.  It will take a few years, but it will cost them more than $5k to be a part of this kind of shady business.\r\n", "author": "tsteele93", "created_utc": "1193783362", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "archived": true, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t1_c02c8gx", "id": "c02c93u", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "ups": -4, "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5zg0e", "retrieved_on": 1427424951, "body": "You assume I am not a parent, based on what you've experienced as a parent.

I expect a corporation to want to do FAIR BUSINESS with me.  That means that if I sign up for Sprint and pay for their unlimited messages I want them to excercise responsible corporate behavior and contact me when they see unusual charges on my account.  This isn't exceptional or unique, credit card companies do it without fail.\r\n\r\nSprint KNOWS when they allow shady \"premium text\" companies to charge your account for $10k in a month that they have allowed you to be screwed over when they were SUPPOSED TO BE your business partner.\r\n\r\nIt is called a \"business relationship.\"  My bank would call me if there was someone trying to cash a suspicious check on my account to verify that it was not a scam.  My vet would call me if someone brought in one of my dogs for treatment while claiming it as their own.  My realtor would tell me if I was looking at a property that had problems he/she knew about.  They would do it because it is good business to look out for your customers.\r\n\r\n&gt;The father for some dubious reason thought that allowing his developmentally-challenged daughter to be responsible for a cell phone in his name. \r\n\r\nYes, apparently that \"dubious reason\" was that he thought Sprint was a responsible company and he had paid for an unlimted text message plan.  He didn't expect Sprint to allow shady \"premium text\" companies to run up $10k in bills during a single month without contacting him.\r\n\r\n&gt;It's an unfortunate situation but its reality... which is often unfair. Tough.\r\n\r\nNo, it is crappy business on Sprint's part.  Basically you are correct.  Sprint can do whatever they like because in the fine print letter of the contract they win.  And that is fine with me.  But I support anything that puts this story in front of as many people as possible, because they should know - apparently if you do business with Sprint, you cannot trust them to have your best interests in mind and you cannot trust them to behave in a responsible manner in order to protect your accounts.  The next step is to identify companies that automatically \"opt you out\" of premium text services UNLESS you tell them it is ok.  Because most people have no idea these even exist and most people who sign up for unlimited text messages would believe they've BEEN RESPONSIBLE and made the effort to ensure that they are not surprised with an exorbitant bill.  So I'd want to do business with a company that wasn't leaving me wide open to shady fees from shady companies that have \"fine print\" charges that are astonishingly out of line with what a customer might typically expect a text message to cost.  I'd want to spend my money with a company that is more solid than Sprint has been in this case.\r\n\r\nAnd do the math.  My bill runs in the $75 a month range.  Sprint can take their $5k up front, but they will never get another dollar from that man or his family and probably some people who read this article.
