I wondered what we were there for once we pushed through the country and found no IED's.\n\nDuring my four years of service I began doing a lot of reading and research into 9/11 and I have become pretty convinced that it was an inside job staged by the MIC with Al Qaeda involvement extremely minimal at best. I do not want us to invade Iran. I personally believe that any ill will against us by Muslims has been brought on by our overly aggressive foreign policy. Our ignorant stance on maintaining our own hegemonious primacy pisses people off. We need to stop, imo.\n\nRon Paul's idea of restoring our policy of \"trade with all, favors for none\"(Thomas Jefferson quote, not sure if that was exact) is exactly what I feel we need to keep terrorism from ever touching our shores.\n\nTo sum things up:\n\nNumber of children I killed in Iraq: 0\n\nNumber of women I killed in Iraq: 0\n\nKilograms of food, candy, and clean water I gave to kids and women to their extreme delight: A fucking shitload.\n\nNumber of non-local insurgents killed by our platoon (one group actually beheaded the son of a fisherman for no reason other than to scare the locals) : a bunch\n\nNumber of local insurgents killed: over a dozen (They were confirmed. You don't dig on the side of the highway at 0230 when you are looking for your lost dog. And you don't have an AK laying next to you while you are digging.)\n\nNumber of insurgents detained: A couple. 5-10 maybe.\n\nIraq's occupation is wrong, but there is no doubt in my mind that we improved the quality of life in our AO during our time there. Of course nobody cares because the rest of the country has gotten shittier, and I don't blame them. It's a God damned quagmire and we need to pull out.\n\nDo you understand things now?", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "name": "t1_c02c3l4", "ups": 1, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5z4bl", "retrieved_on": 1427425013, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02c3l4", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "parent_id": "t1_c02c38s", "body": "Like I wrote, it's inappropriate to pick on those that lack capacity.
