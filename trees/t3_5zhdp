I was wondering if you could talk about that both for the administration and organizations.\n\n&gt;LEDERER: In the labor trafficking area, I think we are very much aware of boy trafficking for camel jockeys and for specific kinds of forced labor, such as agricultural or construction work. In terms of sex trafficking, we are much less aware of the extent of the problem. In addition, I think sex trafficking of boys is a taboo topic. This Administration is aware that we need to address sex trafficking of males as well as females. I will bring back your concern about transgendered people too. I think it is very important. \nsource: http://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/rm/48308.htm", "author_flair_css_class": null}
