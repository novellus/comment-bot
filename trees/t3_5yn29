The other was knowing that I could disagree with other people - and, still, I had my own little thought in my head, and it was well structured and it was correct for me. And they could have their own. It's like the song says: 'There ain't no good guy, there ain't no bad guy, there's only you and me and we just disagree.'\"\n\n--amazing. i think that's what we all hope to find one day, isn't it?", "author_flair_css_class": null}
