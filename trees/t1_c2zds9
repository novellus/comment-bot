The \"palestinian\" establishment is a farce which fluctuates between thieving terrorist scum like Arafat and impotent, confused leadership such as Abu Maazan. Internal political disputes in \"Palestinian Authority\" are solved with machine guns. In this chaos, and with all the terrorist gangs involved, it is very easy to evade any kind of responsibility. What kind of leverage does Israel have over them, other than physically invading their cities and killing off armed people? \n\nThe \"Palestinian Authority\" is not a legitimate government, and does not function as one. As an establishment without obligations, it is in unique position in which it has complete freedom to do whatever it pleases and blame any misdeeds on \"independent\" terrorists - that is exactly what Arafat did. When an arab blows himself up in a mall killing 20 people, what are you going to do? The \"palestinians\" didn't do it, the terrorists did. \n\nI don't want to sound as if I want to deny the \"palestinians\" rights to their own country, even though I believe that judging by 2007 standards they don't deserve it; the problem is, the \"palestinians\" have had exactly as much time as Israel did to launch their own country, but they chose to try to push off the jews instead - regardless of the pressure from their arab neighbors and oppression the Israeli governments have inflicted, they always had that option. \n\nIsrael has no vested interest in harming \"palestinians\". Violently maintaining control over their terrorist aspirations, which I see as completely illegitimate regardless of their cause, is a huge drain on Israel, in terms of money, lives, domestic and international public opinion. We understand that in the long term, the \"palestinians\" would not go away; we can not get rid of them, we can't buy them off and we can't move them around. The only possible way to arrive to permanent ceasefire involves the \"palestinians\" laying down arms, because just like them, we are not about to allow anyone to get rid of us, buy us off or move us elsewhere.
