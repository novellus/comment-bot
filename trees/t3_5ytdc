I'd blame Marxism, which whilst being atheistic, functioned in the exact same way as a religion, only more intensely. \n\nMarxism is a perfect example of whats fundamentally problematic about religion. That a social order needs to be prescribed so as to change the innermost character of humans from without so as to achieve a heaven and avoid a hell; in marxism it was communist utopia that was heaven and capitalistic exploitation that was hell.\n\nIts good that Christianity has avoided much of the harms that Marxism caused, by Christianity being quite flexible in its interpretations (largely a result of the fact that Christianity was wet-nursed by the political expediency of Constantine and the First Papal Council in the third century). So Christianity has always been a politically realistic religion, unlike Islam which is far more rigid in its idealism. \n\nBut Christianity's need to impose from without changes on people's innermost character for the sake of achieving heaven did motivate good men to commit crimes in the Inquisition. And they were good men. Don't try to wriggle out of that one. The Pope eventually halted the Inquisition very early on, because he felt it un-Christian. But while happening the chose burning as the death, because they really did want the sinners to go to heaven, so they didn't want to spill their blood.\n\nMore to the point, it is love of right that lures men to wrong.\n\nAs such the more important point is not that you believe you are pure, or that you only attribute goodness to people after the results of their good actions have been realised. No. It is more important to have a framework for deciding WHAT is good. And Christianity is half way there. Unfortunately, secularist societies have proven more humane, and better managed. \n\nI would never seek to dissuade you of your faith.
