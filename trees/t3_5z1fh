There are many application areas for C++: high performance code, games, even standard desktop software that is fast to start, fast to run and does not eat obscene amounts of memory and does not trash your harddisk when garbage collection mark-and-sweep causes VM swapping. Software like Netbeans makes me wanna puke.\r\n\r\nAnd no, none of your obscure languages like D that few people are familiar with do count, no matter how good are they, unless you are a lone wolf that does not work in a team and does not want to share the source.\r\n\r\nAnd no, C is not superior to C++. I am tired with manually managing every bit, it's so pointless and error prone. Except in bottlenecks - and C++ allows you to drop to lower level whenever you need.\r\n\r\nC++ is ugly, C++ is complex. Suck it up.
