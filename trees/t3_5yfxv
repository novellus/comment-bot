This started at the local level, but it has shot through the system now.  What commercial media wants and needs for its survival is news that is evocative, free, brief, and inescapable.  You might disagree, alright, but your avenue of dissent from what's on channel 25 is playing on channel 40, in a pre-digested form.  Ann Coulter figured this out brilliantly.  She makes herself news, and then she makes the contrived controversies she creates news, and best of all she will show up on your pundit show gratis.  Her take comes from books and speaking fees, I imagine.  For commercial media, it's a win-win.  Face it, even her imagined enemies deeply need someone to play her part.  Keith Olbermann would not be who he is if Ann Coulter were not who she is.  It is a self-contained, self-reinforcing, self-producing nonsense machine.
