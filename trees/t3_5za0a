Since, the rate was not mentioned in the four page special advertorial, obviously everybody had read my blog before coming here, i assumed.\n\nOf course, there was a printed rate structure along with the brochure but i did not see anybody reading it. Most of the people must have forgotten their glasses at home, i thought.\n\nWhen salesman said basic rate is Rs. 3,200, everybody was happy. When he pointed out that there is 20 rupees rise per floor from 8th floor, everybody looked more happy. It was the happiest moment of the day when salesman said from 21st to 25th floor rate is Rs. 3,800 per sq.ft.\n\nWhen somebody asked about the possibilities of rate increase , salesman said 'anytime'. If he had increased the rate at that moment, i am sure, everybody would have started dancing with joy.", "author": "ravikarandeekar", "created_utc": "1193551587", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c02brf2", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5za0a", "name": "t1_c02brf2", "author_flair_css_class": null}
