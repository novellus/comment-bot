Your \"he doesn't get to dictate\" is, itself, a form of belief dictation -- he's expressing his beliefs, telling us how he feels, and you're attacking him for that as though he's not allowed to feel that way because it somehow makes you feel bad for feeling differently.\n\n&gt; He is obviously reactionary\n\nFunny -- I didn't get that at all.\n\n&gt; I disagree, I think he sounds like a meat head and any good points he had to make get lost in the fact that he sounds shallow and simpleminded.\n\nI find that ironic, considering how simplistic your \"refutation\" is.  You haven't even provided any reasonable counterargument or specific points of disagreement.  You just call him a reactionary \"meathead\" and attack him for having a belief he's willing to share with the world regardless of how much those who disagree with him might ridicule him for it.  If anything, I'd say that's a reasonably courageous act in a world where having strong opinions (especially in conflict with the current politically correct position) is generally used as an excuse for personal attacks (like yours).", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02au1s", "id": "c02audy", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c02au1s", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "ups": 0, "link_id": "t3_5yy0e", "retrieved_on": 1427425674, "id": "c02au1s", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02au0h", "body": "No, actually.
