It was such when I was looking in the area. I found that fayetteville AR was very snobby and I allready had people there screming I was the devil for wearing black the moment I got out of the car.

If you wanted a normal looking apartment they are 800-900/mo for a 2 bedroom and they were not even as large as Raleigh, nc. That area is also full of very rude people that will hang up on you if you ask them to see an apartment. Fort Smith is also full of rude  and dirty people.
