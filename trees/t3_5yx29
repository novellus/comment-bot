It imputes more tolerance and acceptance of diversity than was actually the case. \n   The writer makes the point that gods could be local, but in reality every god was local, in the sense that culture and belonging was defined basically along the lines of who you worshipped - it is for this reason that Aeneas brings his gods from Troy to Rome; *they embody* his culture and his history. Equally the strange deities of foreign peoples are just as much touchstones for prejudice and fear as religious symbolism is these days; different cultures defined themselves in opposition to each other by mutual rejection of their cultic practices. What made the Greeks Greek was not their language so much as their shared mythology and cult histories - having the gods of the Greeks to bond over did not make Persian deities any more comprehensible, but made other established practices seem to be distorted versions of their own. This repulsion from foreign cults led to legal bans on the importation of cult practices and establishment of temples to foreign deities in Rome until the Punic wars, and even then figures such as Isis and Cybele were hardly seen as respectable and on par with their own gods. \n   Religion was then as much a source of division as now, with wars sanctified by gods who belonged solely to the town or village invoking them - there was no conception that one's enemies had the same divine rights and favour as oneself. Monotheism, for all its faults and failures, was an influence in Europe throughout the middle ages against wars amongst Christians; the concept of an all inclusive religious community that one can join through sheer confessional belief was foreign to the Greeks and Romans, for whom belief was *not* as integral as worship. Universal compassion and tolerance of diversity were not distinguishing features of the ancient world.", "author": "flightlessbird", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "score": 2, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_5yx29", "id": "c02au5r", "author_flair_css_class": null}
