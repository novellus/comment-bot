Universities started to get passed the burden for training employees sometime after World War 2, probably because all of the GIs returning to go to college on the GI Bill were also returning to the work force. \nActually, universities didn't focus so much on the major until recently. Mostly this is because people would go off to college to study strictly academic subjects (literature, philosophy, the sciences). Universities existed to produce the \"elite\" in society (which usually meant the children of the rich). \nFor instance, the English major didn't exist until around that period (40s or 50s). Before that, if you wanted to study literature, you'd study the classics -- Greek, Roman literature, British literature, etc. That's still how it works in older schools, even some Ivy League schools. \nNow that every white kid with better than a 2.0 GPA goes off to college, the colleges are swollen with people that are there to \"get a job\". So it makes sense that non-academic majors crept up (communications, anyone?), because it helped sell degrees. It's sad, but that's what they're doing -- selling degrees. And making 'fun' degrees is a marketing technique.\n\nEDIT: After reading this, I sound very bitter and snobby. I'm not.
