I thought this story was about police officers stabbing people with needles without displaying their phlebotomist paperwork (which they don't have).\n\nI help them for the same reason that we have public defenders, trial by jury, and a judicial branch which is separate from the executive.\n\nThe first link on the page I linked to is \"Don't drink and drive!\".  I didn't include it in my list because it's obvious.\n\nOn a personal note, I'm sick and tired of being harassed at DUI checkpoints, which (in my opinion) are unconstitutional stops.  The supreme court agreed with me, but *somehow* found that they were ok because it was only a minor infringement (thanks, Rehnquist).  I've also been in the car with a friend who had a beer, was stopped, harassed, arrested, and then passed the test with flying colors.\n\nThere are lots of more constitutional and intelligent ways of deterring people from driving drunk.  Here are some off the top of my head:\n\n1. Let people drink before they can drive (say, beer at 16 and driving at 18?)\n2. Encourage neighborhood bars and clubs in suburbia.  We're terrified of them: they'll bring drunk drivers!  lordy...\n3. Provide mass transit, and provide it at times when people may be drinking.  Instead we do the opposite (stopping long before closing time, if transit exists in any meaningful way in the first place).\n4. End closing times for bars and clubs.  Hey I know, let's kick all the drunk people out of bars at 2 am, putting them all on the road at the same time! Genius.\n5. If you do have closing times, mandate that clubs stay open for at least 2 hours after they stop serving alcohol.  Dance and burn off those vodka-bulls.\n6. Design cities for biking and walking.\n\nYou'll note that these all involve systemic problems with our approach to alcohol that can't be fixed with mothers lobbying to \"throw anyone who drinks in jail!!!!\"  ", "author": "furyg3", "created_utc": "1192600395", "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 25, "parent_id": "t1_c029m4x", "id": "c029m9o", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "created_utc": "1192600751", "name": "t1_c029ma5", "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5yfy1", "retrieved_on": 1427426241, "score": 5, "score_hidden": false, "body": "&gt;Why are you helping those who put your life in danger?

Do they not need both? Having a blood test done by anyone but a trained professional, in a sterile, well lit environment, would freak most people out. But charging someone with no evidence other than a breath test is also a little concerning.\n\nHere in Australia, where the legal driving limit is just .05 - you need to fail a breath test, and then fail a blood test to actually be convicted of drink driving. No blood test is done without first being subjected to, and failing, a standard breath test. And the blood test is normally done either at a police station, hospital or inside a booze bus. That said, we are breath tested whenever you are pulled over by police, and they set up random breath testing stations and do everyone that goes through. We don't have the right to refuse the test like you do, but most people don't care - because we don't want drunk people on the roads.
