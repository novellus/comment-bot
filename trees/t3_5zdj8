Escaping is when you massage data into a syntax that is suitable for some other purpose.  It's part of the *output* layer.\n\nThis mistake in thinking is the kind of thing that causes all of those stupid spurious \\\\' droppings all over poorly-coded PHP applications, SQL injection vulnerabilities, XSS attacks, etc.  Developers are passing around all this data they are trying to operate on, only it's not actually the data, it's the data after it has been obfuscated.\n\nEscaping is something bound to an output method.  You don't escape SQL data in the same way as HTML data, you don't escape HTML data in the same way you escape JSON data, you don't escape JSON data the same way as you escape URI data, and so on.\n\nBy teaching people that it is part of the input layer, you doom them to writing code that carefully picks its way around the escaping obfuscation, or worse &amp;mdash; they simply disable it.  And they don't think about appropriate escaping when the time comes to output it.\n\nAnd really, you shouldn't have to think about escaping 95% of the time anyway; your output system should do that for you.\n", "subreddit_id": "t5_2fwo", "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": "t3_5zdj8", "ups": 1, "author_flair_css_class": null}
