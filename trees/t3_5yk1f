Greenspan looked stunned, and then said that\r\nwas a good question; he actually talked about fiat money vs. a gold\r\nstandard. Now, the ex-Fed chairman is not about to endorse our sound\r\nmonetary policy, but you know our Revolution is working when such a\r\nquestion is asked in the mainstream media, and this powerful man gives\r\nsuch an answer.\r\n\r\nYou and I are reopening a whole host of questions that the\r\nestablishment thought it had closed off forever: on war, on taxes and\r\nspending, on inflation and gold, and on the rule of law and our\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, I asked a famous conservative columnist a question.\r\nWhat did he think about the prospects for a restored Robert Taft wing\r\nof the Republican party? He thought I was joking. As you know, I was\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nAfter all the aggressive wars, the assaults on our privacy and civil\r\nliberties, the oppressive taxation, and the crazed spending and\r\ndeficits, I believe that many Republican voters are ready to return to\r\nour roots. And the big boys feel it too. It is no coincidence that the\r\nRepublican National Committee invited me to a fundraising dinner\r\ninvolving only \"top-tier candidates.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the opposition claims that I am not a \"real Republican,\"\r\nwhereas I am the only one in the race. And our campaign is registering\r\nnew Republican voters by the boatload. None of my opponents is doing\r\nanything approaching that.\r\n\r\nOf course, they pooh-pooh our success. \"He's just registering\r\nDemocrats and Independents and people who have never voted before.\"\r\nWell, yes. It's called growth. We are laying the groundwork for the\r\nprimaries.\r\n\r\nAll over America, our support is wide and deep and growing, and young\r\npeople are joining like never before. After the Dearborn debate, I\r\nwent to the University of Michigan for a rally. 2,000 students turned\r\nout, something that has happened to no other candidate this year.\r\n\r\nThe crowd cheered all our ideas, but especially our opposition to the\r\nFederal Reserve, and our support for real money of gold and silver, as\r\nthe Constitution mandates, instead of prosperity-wrecking fiat money.\r\nAmerican politics hasn't seen anything like this in many decades. It\r\nis truly revolutionary.\r\n\r\nBut time is getting short. We must do massive radio and TV\r\nadvertising, open many small offices (three in just South Carolina the\r\nother day), staff them, pay all the bills, and turn out our vote with\r\nmassive organizational and phone-bank efforts.\r\n\r\nAs you know, the blackout is ending; our campaign is starting to get\r\nmainstream media attention, thanks to growing donations and\r\nvolunteers. And contributions are the key to more attention, and to\r\nour being able to do the actual work of victory. Good news: our recent\r\ngreen-eyeshade analysis of all the candidates' net finances, which got\r\nso much press attention, shows our campaign as one of only three in\r\nthe top-tier.\r\n\r\nBut we must keep moving up, and the Iowa caucuses are now on January\r\n3rd. The New Hampshire primary may be in early December!\r\n\r\nAs always, everything depends on you. Please, make the most generous\r\ndonation you canhttps://www.ronpaul2008.com/donate/ as soon as you\r\ncan. I need your help so badly.\r\n\r\nThe other day, an 8-year-old boy handed me a small white envelope. It\r\ncontained the $4.00 he had saved from his allowance, as a donation to\r\nour campaign. I can't tell you how seriously I take my responsibility\r\nto work hard, and spend frugally and effectively, to be worthy of his\r\nsupport, and yours.\r\n\r\nPlease help me keep working, even harder and more effectively, for all\r\nwe believe in. Without you, I'd have to pack it in. Donate now\r\nhttps://www.ronpaul2008.com/donate/ .We have more than an election to\r\nwin. We have a country to save.\r\n\r\nRon Paul\r\n", "author": "EdgerErnst", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": -1, "parent_id": "t3_5yk1f", "id": "c029t62", "author_flair_css_class": null}
