I don't know when life begins and hence why I take the stance of erring on the side of caution and not supporting abortions.  I do not think a clump of cells is a human being and would support the use of \"the morning after pill\" -- specifically for use in rape cases and not really to be used to correct drunken mistakes.  I do believe abortions are medically necessary only when they pose a severe medical risk to the mother or child, but should not because you can't keep your legs closed.\n\nJust my two cents.", "author": "washcapsfan37", "created_utc": "1192563373", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_5yfnj", "id": "c029jah", "author_flair_css_class": null}
