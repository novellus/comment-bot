And I myself in turn was doing better than a friend who was smarter than me but even lazier.  So these friends were just known for really being able to put in the time and grind it out, and they would consistently produce just amazing stuff.\n\nSo at one point I was confronted with the choice to take an Operating Systems class (a legendarily hard class) or an easier alternative.  The advisor told me it wasn't about which one had harder work, it was about what I wanted to do (i.e. an unhelpful answer).  And I decided that there was no point in taking the easy way, because then getting my degree would mean nothing, so I took the hard course, and decided to just work really hard at it.\n\nI ended up getting a B (my typical grade).  But the stuff I produced was simply so much MORE than anything else in the past, and I found that through sheer will (working hard really is just something you will yourself to do), I could turn my smarts into Real Stuff.\n\nSo the realization was basically that I could create \"things of great value\" (in my case that's mostly just software - but that's pretty valuable these days) simply by deciding to do so and applying my will.  You normally think that creating great things requires stuff like capital, material resources, etc, but it's not true.  It's just will - you summon it, and if you can keep yourself going, sooner or later you've basically pronounced gold into existence - yeah, sometimes you need to go and do things like procure raw materials, but you just *go and figure out how to do it.*\n\nOne bonus effect is that you learn what smartness really does for you: it's a multiplier.  It doesn't give you success for nothing (i.e. 5000 x 0 = 0), but if you apply smarts to a work ethic, your output is multiplied (i.e. 5000 x 10 = 50000).  So a smart person who learns to work hard benefits far more than a mediocre person who works hard.\n\nThis benefit becomes very addictive: \"whoa, by sheer force of will I can essentially call into being wealth for myself!\" and that's what keeps you from backsliding.  Human beings respond well to positive feedback loops, and the benefits of hard work (especially for a smart person) are very quickly and directly reaped.  So that's how you prevent backsliding - it's not likely to happen, once you meet your first real success.\n\n", "author": "yishan", "created_utc": "1193816557", "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "author_flair_css_class": null, "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c02cbrg", "parent_id": "t1_c02cak4", "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02cbrg"}, {"controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "created_utc": "1193817209", "name": "t1_c02cbsc", "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5zcvn", "retrieved_on": 1427424907, "score": 3, "score_hidden": false, "body": "The short answer practical advice:\n\nJust try doing something hard.

Then later I'm going to come back to it.  I'm never going to try to finish, and what I'm going to do is just grind away at it for fun, even if I'm not doing so well.\"\n\nWhen you give up on the idea of \"it's gotta be done,\" then you can immerse yourself in the \"doing\" of the task.  And you'll just work away at it, not intent on the finish line but rather, intent on doing a good job on the part you're focusing on right then.\n\nThen, before you know it, you'll be done.  And you'll have a FINE, FINISHED PRODUCT.
