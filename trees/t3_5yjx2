Also war with China isn't as far-fetched as you would think. While the economic tensions between the two could spark conflict, it is unlikely.  \r\n\r\nA more pressing concern would be the 2008 Olympics. If Taiwan was going to pick anytime to offically succeed from China they would pick then because they would be betting that China wouldn't attack them. However, China probably would, if not during the Olympics then definately afterwards.  Taiwan has a security treaty with the USA, so if China does attack them, Uncle Sam is obligated to come to the rescue. It would just escalate from there, maybe not into nuclear war but probably into a pretty bad slog.
