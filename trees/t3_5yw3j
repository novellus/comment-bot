Well, yeah, a lot of Americans are naive and exaggerate the importance of 9/11, but as far as comparing it with the IRA, you could do the make a similar comparison with the US in the 1960s.\n\nIf we had the kind of violence today that we had back then, people would be out of their minds with fear and anguish. A President assassinated, a national leader assassinated, a former attorney general and presidential candidate assassinated, and that's just the top three. How about 50,000 dead in Viet Nam? How about the Watts Riots?\n\nYeah, Americans need to get some perspective, but you could trivialize this lady's entire IRA argument by comparing British suffering to that of Cambodia, or Rwanda and Burundi.\n", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5yw3j", "id": "c02aoq9", "author_flair_css_class": null}
