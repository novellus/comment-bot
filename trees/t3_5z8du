In addition, Saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer-range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies.\"\nLetter to President Bush, Signed by:\n-- Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL), and others, Dec 5, 2001\n\n\"We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandate of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and th! e means of delivering them.\"\n-- Sen. Carl Levin (D, MI), Sept. 19, 2002\n\n\"We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country.\"\n-- Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002\n\n\"Iraq's search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power.\"\n-- Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002\n\n\"We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction.\"\n-- Sen. Ted Kennedy (D, MA), Sept. 27, 2002\n\n\"The last UN weapons inspectors left Iraq in October of 1998. We are confident that Saddam Hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities. Intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons...\"\n-- Sen. Robert Byrd (D, WV), Oct. 3, 2002\n\n\"I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force -- if necessary -- to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security.\"\n-- Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Oct. 9, 2002\n\n\"There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years ... We also should remember we have always underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction.\"\n-- Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D, WV), Oct 10, 2002\n\n\"He has systematically violated, over the course of the past 11 years, every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons, and any nuclear capacity. This he has refused to do\"\n-- Rep. Henry Waxman (D, CA), Oct. 10, 2002\n\n\"In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members ... It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons.\"\n-- Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), Oct 10, 2002\n\n\"We are in possession of what I think to be compelling evidence that Saddam Hussein has, and has had for a number of years, a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction.\"\n-- Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL), Dec. 8, 2002\n\n\"Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime ... He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation ... And now he is miscalculating America's response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction ... So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real...\"\n-- Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Jan. 23. 2003   ", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 2, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5z8du", "retrieved_on": 1427425218, "id": "c02bnro", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02bnro", "parent_id": "t1_c02bng1", "body": "&gt; The deranged-Left will believe any lie it tells itself!\n\nHow are those WMD's in Iraq working out?", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "score_hidden": false, "ups": -10, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5z8du", "retrieved_on": 1427425222, "body": " Wow!\n\nThe deranged-Left will believe any lie it tells itself!
