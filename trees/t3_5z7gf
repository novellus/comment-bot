Absolutely true. \n\nSo depending on who reads a thread, the eyeballs that judge that thread's comments are not going to be as universal as those applied to voting on submissions, and worse particular threads may attract particular crowds of people who are predisposed to similar thinking, thus violating the diversity of wisdom crowds and causing a local stampede, which could damage a global reputation.\n\nSo given these potential points of failure can a good comment karma system be designed to prevent them? I think this is a definite yes, but it will take a good bit of thinking.\n\nMost people who have participated in this discussion seem to be saying the idea of having a separate comment karma useful. So I'm going to claim that the question of this submission has been answered in the affirmative.\n\nThe next step for all of us therefore is to describe what a working comment karma system would look like, how it would behave, what problems it could have and how to resolve those problems.\n\nAnd starting out with descriptions of how comment karma systems could go horrible wrong is a great way to beginning creating a picture of how a good one would work.

And who knows -- when I reregister, I might come back as a bug! ;)\r\n\r\nTo be sure, that's not a critique of your reasoning, but an acknowledgment that I may be drifting out of reddit's current demographic.  It's the old madness/wisdom of crowds problem, and it may be intractable in an open system.  \r\n\r\nYour gaming analogy is apt, but in that context stats work *because* of mitigating factors:  most game systems have clear rules, are moderated (GM'd), and are conducted as small, interdependent communities.

What does karma currently measure? It measures how much other people on reddit vote up your submissions, essentially it says the reddit community in aggregate likes to read what you find for them.\n\nComments, while using votes to rate them within a submission thread, are really an entirely separate process from submitting things. And comment karma would really be useful only in the context of conversations. \n\nSo show comment karma (or a near-time approximation of it) next to the userid in conversations, and submission karma next to the user id on the submission pages. \n\nSo how would comment karma help?\n\nIf an account is always saying things found to be useless and irritating to most users it would be handy to have that reflected next to the name of the account. On the other hand if a lisp genius is holding court it would be really nice for her comment karma to reflect that next to her name in each of her posts.\n\nAlso it can be an indicator to the value of a disagreement if people are getting heavily downmodded for a particular position, though their overall comment karma is high. Ideally this might indicate a high quality disagreement over a complex issue, where it's really worth reading both sides. Where as issue trolls will tend to see their kneejerk responses accumulate the consequences of such  bad behavior.\n\nMost role playing games model their participants with a small number of stats, because it makes sense to measure and account each of those stats independently from each other. Too many stats gets unwieldy, ala Microsoft word, but this can be avoided by carefully modeling the skill upon which the stats are based.\n\nAnd clearly commenting is a very different thing from submitting.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02blrc", "id": "c02blts", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "author_flair_text": null, "name": "t1_c02bm2d", "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5z7gf", "retrieved_on": 1427425240, "score": 0, "body": "Comment karma would be very useful in knowing whether you are responding to a serial troll or not.", "author": "OsakaWilson", "created_utc": "1193456275", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "ups": 0, "parent_id": "t1_c02blrc", "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02bm2d"}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 5, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5z7gf", "retrieved_on": 1427425244, "id": "c02blrc", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02blrc", "parent_id": "t1_c02blho", "body": "As a data guy, I agree wholeheartedly.

[My comments are generally modded up](http://reddit.com/user/strolls/comments) and I like to think that this is because they're insightful &amp; thoughtful, or instead funny.\n\nOn about a dozen occasions now [I've submitted stories](http://reddit.com/user/strolls/submitted) and I reckon them to be better than the average submission - many of them I've discovered and thought to myself *\"bwhahahahaha... they'll love this on Reddit\"*, yet none of these have ever made the top 50 stories. My stories typically get modded down to zero, or occasionally  receive one or two upmods - never more than this.\n\nWhen I look at some other posters - anonymgirl, for instance - who have stories on the front page every day, then this just doesn't make sense to me. I'm not criticising  anonymgirl, I just think my stories are, on average, as good as hers.\n\nYou could reply to me by saying that if I put in as much time posting new stories as anonymgirl then maybe I might achieve her karma, but that's not really what I'm after. I love reading Reddit - it's just very well balanced for my intellectual stimulation needs - and since it's supposed to be a community-orintated submission-driven website I just want to \"give something back\" and \"make my mark\" a little. It's so easy to submit a story here, so it's quite frustrating to see one's submissions so unappreciated.\n\nI do make an effort most days to have a quick look at the \"new\" page. It seems so flooded with SEO- and blog-spammers that I can only conclude this is why my stories don't get a chance. They don't stay on the new page very long and so don't get a chance to receive a few upmods. I can only conclude that the regular posters who get their stories on the front page every day have been here since before the spammers discovered Reddit, received a bit of karma at that time and have never had the inertia that I - and my submissions - do.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
