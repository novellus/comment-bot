Empathy in those terms is based on imagination, not reality. Your empathy would carry more weight had you experienced those things - again as you likely very well know. You cannot understand \"well enough\" until you've done it and no amount of protestation otherwise can change that. It merely makes you look foolish. \r\n\r\nThat in itself is a typical and hackneyed response fallen back on by the inexperienced everywhere. \"But I have a right to my OPINION!\"  Yes, you do, as do we all. Expect it to be given the appropriate weight.\r\n\r\n&gt; My overall point is that making choices because \"it's just what you do when you grow up\" is poor set of criteria...\r\n\r\nAgreed. It certainly is. However if you are trying to attribute that argument to me, it's another strawman. \r\n\r\n&gt; and implying that someone elses angst is lesser because they haven't, perhaps yet, done those things is a common, but poor, argument.\r\n\r\nNot \"perhaps yet\", for certain NOT yet. I'm not implying it, I'm flat-out stating it. Sticking to the basis of the original article, the young adult is complaining about the hardships of living at home while carrying debt. Based on that I am flat-out stating that this person has nothing to cry about...now we may say \"perhaps yet\". I am basing that statement on the reality of life experience, not empathy or opinion based on my imaginings of what that entails. Reality vs. imaginings is hardly a \"poor argument\" no matter how tired you are of hearing it.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 1, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5yyml", "retrieved_on": 1427425560, "id": "c02b2vj", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02b2vj", "parent_id": "t1_c02b2r3", "body": "There is nothing disingenous in my responses.\r\n\r\nOriginally you took a rather hackneyed stance that can be summed up as saying \"hey kid, you don't know about problems, wait'll you have to do all the things that real life requires\".\r\n\r\nAnd as the very tired \"you can't possibly know until you do it\" argument, bullshit.
