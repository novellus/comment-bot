Huh?  There is nothing whatsoever in this article to suggest what your headline says.  \n\nAs far as I am aware, Obama's black heritage is through his father, a Kenyan.  His mother is a white woman from Kansas, and I'm sure this is the branch of the family tree which is connected to the Cheneys.  \n\nFurthermore, the article CLEARLY STATES that their common ancestor was of French heritage, and that their relation was by marriage, not ownership.\n\nI would be very surprised if the Cheneys owned a French family.\n\nI'm no Cheney fan either, but come on, lies and misleading headlines are not the way to protest.  We are a sound-byte and headline culture, and many many people will see your headline and pass it on without ever reading the article or verifying the facts on their own.
