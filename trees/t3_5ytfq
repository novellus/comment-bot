That is \"talk to children about sex\". The new puritanism that has been introduced via fear of pedophilia has many people in this culture refusing to accept any statement that even tends to hint that people become sexual beings before their 18th birthday, or any statement made to those who haven't reached their 18th birthday that people are sexual beings. \n\nYou can't say certain things at all in a kids' book, or about young characters in any book. You will be character-assassinated, ostracized, and shunned. (Look at the Wikipedia entry on Piers Anthony if you need an example.) \n\nHer vanilla approach to sex might be personal or tactical PR, but every vanilla approach to sex, personal or not, is a facade adopted for image reasons, because everyone's kinky. They're all either fucking and sucking and spanking and tying each other up behind closed doors, or they really want to be and just can't fucking *admit* it, perhaps even to themselves. \n\nThis is why children's so-called \"sex education\" consists entirely of...\n\n1. How different kinds of venerial disease there are. (700 billion.)\n\n2. How one can get venerial disease. (Merely by holding hands firmly.)\n\n3. Whether getting venerial disease is a big deal. (It is a fate worse than death.)\n\n... rather than any actual sex education, such \"how to give a good blowjob\", or \"how to proposition someone without making an embarrassing mess of it\".\n\nWe stick to trying to scare kids (as if they weren't scared enough already), and withhold all the helpful things we know and could teach them, leaving them to figure out the most messy, stressful and complex of human interactions *entirely on their own*. \n\nWhy do we do this? Because *we're* scared. Scared of being called any number of nasty things, and punished with the kinds of social pressure and ostracism and sanctions that really might be worse than death or close to it. (I challenge any investigative reporter to voluntarily spend a year or two on the \"sex offender\" lists we use to permanently punish people we are suspicious of.
