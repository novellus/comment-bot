While I do realize the necessity to repeat everything that Iran has ever done wrong in the run-up to a war, it is probably more honest to not pretend these historical events as new events.  Here is an article on the original instance:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ateqeh_Rajabi\n\nThis article is very sensational, and very inaccurate in a lot of its claims.  For example, it contains this passage:\n\n&gt; [Iran is] a country where only half of the women can read, only one in 10 have a job and two-thirds are beaten in their homes.  \n\nThe actual [female literacy rate in Iran is 78%](http://www.talent.ac.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=1358), not 50%.  \n\n[Women are educated in Iran](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/03/2006_38_tue.shtml), with over 60% of university students being women now days.  According to [this Iranian article](http://www.payvand.com/news/07/oct/1182.html), over 40% of the workforce is made up of women (and remember that if they made up 50% of the workforce that would be parity with men.)\n\nThis claim that 2/3 of Iranian Women are beaten in their homes is ridiculous.  Which human rights organization are these statistics coming from?", "author_flair_css_class": null}
