What I take issue with is the assumption that religion makes people good. Just because religion exists does not magically make bad people disappear so it seemed slightly off base to me.\n\nWell, religion doesn't \"magically\" make anyone better.  I truly believe, and could provide evidence for the fact, that religion can make many people better than they would be without it.  Like anything tainted by humanity, religion itself can be used to justify gratuitous evil sadly, but in the media today religion has gotten a horrible wrap.\n\nAll we see these days is the Pat Robertsons and the President Bush's and the Jesus Camps and nary a word about the positive effects of religion.  Reddit is rife with horrible stories of \"indoctrinations\" and 1st amendment issues and theocracy scares.\n\nIt is mostly Christianity in America's fault for this negative imagery because Christianity is certainly guilty of warping the message and participating in scandals.  I can only hope that the image slowly creeps back to the positive, because Christianity specifically and many religions can be an extremely positive influence in peoples' lives.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 2, "name": "t1_c029aoi", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_2zd4m", "retrieved_on": 1427426392, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c029aoi", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c0299qa", "body": "&gt;I just said \"yes,\" as in you missed something :).\n\nI know, it just seemed snarky to assume that I only wanted an answer and not an explanation.\n\n&gt;I would encourage you to listen to some conservatives some time, and maybe even give their ideas a chance.\n\nI do.

That, of course, would require you to not dismiss them or label them immediately, but listen to the content of their arguments.  I certainly listen to Liberals and have changed many opinions, and at least understood the other side.  I am certainly not a conservative, but I really think the only way to have a discussion and come to any sort of conclusion in America is to actually talk and not scream at people and dismiss them.\n\nI'd encourage you to read the thread above about religion and you'll understand that the main crux of the argument about removing religion's tax exempt status is that they do no good, so my defense of religion (its sad I even have to) is above.\n\nThanks.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
