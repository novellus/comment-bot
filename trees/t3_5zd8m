Probably because bikers rarely drive like Prius owners. It'll be interesting to see how bike fuel economy changes as the population slowly starts clamoring for maximum fuel economy rather than maximum power or torque. Most motorcycles get anywhere from 50-75 mpg even with outdated carburetors and very simple engines. Like you, I've always thought that pretty abysmal considering that there are many subcompacts from the '70s and '80s that could get around 35-40mpg without trying too hard.

Heat/friction losses are probably much worse in a typical motorcycle engine than a car engine.\n\nYour comparison (curb weight to fuel efficiency) is not considering all the parameters.  I would also look at engine power.  Honda Civics get about 160 hp these days, while your average motorcycles get between 50-90 hp.  Most people use a lot of that power pulling out of a stop, so there you go.\n\nAlso, see here: http://www.suzukifuel.com/\n\nCompare any of those against any non-hybrid car...there are better MPG bikes if you know where to look.

If I could drive 40mph without stopping, I'd get almost 50mpg.\n\nHybrids DRIVEN PROPERLY can beat highway mileage since they can recoup the braking energy to some degree, and don't have to fight as much wind resistance.\n\nI drive my car alternating styles of driving: 1 tank of fun (drive fast, accelerate as much as I want) and 1 tank of efficiency (speed limit driving, accelerate slow, try to coast into lights and off-ramps, etc). I can do 20-30% better than the highway in summer in efficient driving, and much worse otherwise.\n", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5zd8m", "id": "c02c1ep", "author_flair_css_class": null}
