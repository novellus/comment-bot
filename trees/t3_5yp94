It is a savior of the poor, because without it all that's left is \"might makes right\".  Also, grouping in false property rights like slavery to argue against all property rights makes a very poor argument.  Property rights are not a right to control other people, but rather a right not to be controlled regarding the usage of a particular resource.  Society exists to serve individuals, not the other way around.  Individuals are an ends in themselves, not systems.  Typically individuals will organize in systems to secure their liberties and rights, but then have them even if no system exists at all.  Marx was wrong, life is about the eternal struggle for liberty - not the eternal class struggle.
