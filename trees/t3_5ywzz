Your *debating strategy of putting words into my mouth* is stupid. I didn't say *you* were stupid. See, you need to think more clearly.\n\n&gt; Dude you keep going on about how I said that free medical care causes obesity and I never said that, I told you that in a comment and here you are again.\n\nOK, but you wrote the following - it certainly sounds like you are claiming that entitlements cause obesity, and you give medical care as an example of an entitlement:\n\n&gt; I believe that entitlements help make many Americans fat. If you make health care a universal entitlement, anything to do with the health needs of fat people will be covered or the government will get sued.\n\nBut now you're clarifying it, and saying that *other* entitlements cause obesity, but not medical care, right?  For example, you write:\n\n&gt; No job + no incentive to get one + free money to buy tasty food to fill the void in their lives = a fat lazy individual.\n\nOK, so you are implying a causal link between *non-medical* entitlements, and obesity, right? Do I understand correctly now? I don't want to misquote you or misrepresent you.\n\n&gt; In european countries they have the same problems we do with their social welfare programs, but they all take in less immigrants to add to the welfare rolls...\n\nOK, but Europe still has more generous social welfare problems than we do, right? \n\nSo if I understand your theory correctly, that non-medical social welfare programs cause obesity, we should see more obesity in countries with more generous welfare programs, right? We can test your hypothesis scientifically, right? \n\n&gt; Remove the free and easy money and you'll see a dip in the number of fat lazy fucks.\n\nAh! Another prediction, allowing another scientific test! Welfare has been cut in certain states, and there were some significant bipartisan reforms in the Clinton era. Could we find a dip in the obesity rate as welfare was cut, or at a slowing of obesity growth in those areas where it was cut?\n\n\nSo far, what I see in the US is a *correlation* between poverty and obesity, and a similar *correlation* between poverty and social program dependence. To my eyes, this does not demonstrate that welfare causes obesity, any more than welfare causes people to speak substandard English.\n\n", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "parent_id": "t1_c02ayj1", "id": "c02aymq", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 1, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5ywzz", "retrieved_on": 1427425616, "id": "c02ayj1", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "name": "t1_c02ayj1", "parent_id": "t1_c02ax1z", "body": "I'm stupid?

There are genetic factors to take into account, yes.  \nHowever, the endlessly repeated, endlessly avoided mantra \"eat right and exercise\" should be coming into play at some point.\nI live in Wisconsin, the fattest state in the fattest country in the world.  I also work in an ice cream store (amongst other places, I have two jobs and do temp work), so I see a damn lot of people who are morbidly obese.  These people should not be eating ice cream.     Especially not to the frequency some of my regulars do.  But they do.  They get double scoops (9oz of ice cream, at 14% butterfat, that's 35.7203991 grams of fat! That's eating 3 tbsp of butter!), they get chocolate-dipped waffle cones; they don't care about what they're doing to their bodies.\nMy point is, it is in their control to live the way they do.  And I don't have sympathy for people who continually make poor choices.
