Even the cameramen waited a few minutes before starting to help out. They all watched as some poor person with shrapnel in his feet hopped around on his good foot in total shock. CPR would have saved the lives of many people there.\n\nI can understand hiding for a minute to see if there was just one bomb, but until the cops showed up it seemed like everyone had abandoned the injured. That just doesn't sit right with me. It seems like dictatorships sap the humanity out of people.", "author": "entropyfails", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c02a01k", "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c02a01k", "parent_id": "t3_5ymiz", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}
