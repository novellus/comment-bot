So I used the \"recover password\" feature.  Put my username in, got the email, clicked the link.\r\n\r\nUsing Firefox 2.0.0.7 when I went to submit the reset password form it went to a blank page.  I tried this 4-5 times (new password reset email each time) with the same result (blank page after submit).  Using the login box always resulted in the password being rejected (trying my old password or new password).\r\n\r\nI finally tried in IE7, which actually submitted the form.  I was logged in after submitting, but the page I was on (I think it was `/resetpassword`) was a 404 (\"page you requested does not exist\").  I'm logged in now, but I still can't login in using Firefox, it takes me to the login / register page.  I can only use reddit from IE7 now `:(` ", "author_flair_css_class": null}
