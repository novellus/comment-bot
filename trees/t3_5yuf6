THey ranged in price from about $1.25 each to $16.00 each. I put each of them in the same diffused enclosure and photographed them with the same white balance setting to empirically judge color shifts. I also took notes on my own overall impression of the light, and recorded to the exposure settings to determine relative brightness levels. I also asked my roommate what he thought of each bulb, he had no idea which was which. \nThe unfortunate result is that only one of the CFL lamps produced similarly pleasing light to that of a normal incandescent. To the eye, most CFLs appeared to have a reddish or pinkish cast to them, but the photographic record showed them to have a greenish cast. My theory is that there are \"crossed curves\" being produced, meaning the higher energy sections have different color characteristics than the lower energy sections. Whatever it is, it ends up giving the light a slightly unnatural and harsh feeling. These were all 3200K \"warm white\" bulbs.\n\nThe 4K cooler white bulbs on the other hand were great.
