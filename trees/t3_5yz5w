Police officers will be replaced with a strike force with the ability to tap into your phone conversations, spy on your Internet connection, arrest you for no reason or any reason at all, and interrogate you behind closed doors during secret hearings. It'll be awesome, and if anyone complains, they will be labeled unpatriotic. The beauty of it is that people won't protest because protesters will be victims of police brutality. The reason I say victims is because the punishment for the crime of brutalizing police would be murder. It's the criminals who need to be brutalized, not the police.\"", "author": "[deleted]", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "politics", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5yz5w", "id": "c02ayar", "author_flair_css_class": null}
