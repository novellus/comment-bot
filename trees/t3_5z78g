Where I'm at, GSM (Cingular, TMobile, etc) tends to work better.  However there are places nearby that I cannot get a signal, but others on CDMA networks (Alltel around here) pick up just fine.\n\nAsk people in your area what works best (You might try going to an electronics store that sells multiple carriers, like Radioshack or similar).  Also, think about the plans.\n\nCingular offers roll over minutes, which IMO, aren't that great.  Alltel has the very useful My Circle which lets you call 10 numbers unlimited for free (they can be land lines, other carriers, etc).  If you're like me, I don't make long calls to more than 10 people, I could be using close to 0 minutes a month.  (Unfortunately I'm tied into a Cingular contract)  Also, Alltel lets you change your plan at any time, so if you're going on vacation and will be using your phone alot more that month, you can switch up to a higher rate plan for one month then back down.\n\nTMobile has My Faves or something, which is similar to Alltel's My Circle, but with only 5 numbers.\n\nAnother note:  Personally I'd spend the extra $50~ (sometimes up to $100) to get a 1 Year contract.  That way if your phone breaks or you just want a cool new phone after a year you can upgrade without paying full price for the phone ($300+ for what would be a free phone)\n\nAlso:  I'd stay away from insurance.  While it's nice, most policies require a $50 deductible and quite a bit of hassle to make a claim.  Also, if you do get insurance, make sure it covers water damage.  I've seen the repair shops claim water/corrosion damage on a brand new phone.  They will do whatever they can to make money off of you.\n\nIf you're just a casual user, buy a used cingular GSM phone off of ebay and activate it as a prepaid GoPhone.  You'll pay around $20 to activate (the SIM card) and I think the cheapest way to do it is to buy $25 worth of minutes every 3 months.  Your minutes run $.25 a minute (Giving you 100 minutes per 90 days, or 400 minutes a year for $100, plus the cost of activation)\n\nSorry for the diatribe, I worked in an electronics shop &amp; sold Cingular and Alltel, so I know a little about them.\n\nHope this helps!", "author_flair_css_class": null}
