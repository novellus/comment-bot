But if you like 1800, go with it.\r\n\r\n&gt;Now using this site http://www.westegg.com/inflation/ to figure out what the CPI for $1,800 in 1860 works out to in 2006 dollars,\r\n\r\n\r\nNope. Wrong. You need to find the average or median INCOME of a ordinary person at that time and then calculate how many years salary a slave would cost. 150 is the accepted figure for that time frame. IN fact, a field hand earned about 110 $$ a year in 1860. \r\n\r\nBUt others earned more. For example, a very good paying job in that general time frame was as a carpenter building the White House. You could earn $1.50 a day doing that work (that was free white man's wages--indentured white men and black chattel slaves earned only $1 a day on the White House). Of course, after it ended, you had to find more work. Good paying Work was seldom steady. You had to go from job to job if you wanted good money.\r\n\r\nSo, the accepted figure for this general time frame is 150 dollars per year. That was my rubric--annual income and how many years of earnings it would cost to buy one slave. Your inflation stat is meaningles to me and in fact meaningless in general because technologies affected prices. My methodology centered around how many years it would take a man to buy a slave. Period. At 175 $$ a year, it would take anywhere from at least 5 to 10 years to do so--or even more.\r\n\r\n And if you were saving up to buy a fancy maid at $2400, you would work for more than 10 years, probably 20 or more, seeing as how you need $$ to live. Therefore only rich people could buy slaves. Actually only about 1.54 percent of all white Americans owned slaves. And a fair percentage of slaveowners were Indian and black.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for my sources, I have dozens, maybe hundreds!
