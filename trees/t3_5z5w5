Rumsfeld \"authorized and directed [...] crimes\nof torture\" some of which \"constitute war crimes,\" says the complaint.\n\nIf the prosecutor chooses to prosecute Mr. Rumsfeld, it will be first\ntime for him.  Two complaints filed against him for torture in Germany,\nin 2004 and 2006, had been unsuccessful, justice having declared that\nit wasn't competent.\n\nTWO \"EMBL\u00c9MATIQUES\" STORIES\n\nThe complaint was filed Thursday while Mr. Rumsfeld arrived in Paris to\nspeak, on Friday morning, before an audience at the Circle Interalli\u00e9.\nThe International Convention against Torture obliges signatory states\nto pursue, arrest, try or extradite any person residing in their\nterritory that might be guilty of acts of torture abroad, committed\nagainst foreigners.\n\nAccording to Patrick Baudouin, honorary president of the FIDH, the\ncomplaint against Mr. Rumsfeld is \"a very strong symbol in the fight\nagainst impunity,\" since it involves \"the abuses committed by the\nUnited States since September 11, 2001 when they set themselves free\nfrom international law\" in their campaign against terrorism.\n\nIt also shows, according to this lawyer, that \"there is be no double\nstandards\" and that an ex administration official of a large Western\npower can be prosecuted for serious crimes, as well as that of an African\ncountry, for example.\n\nTwo emblematic stories are mentioned: that of a former detainee\nat Guantanamo, Mohamed Al-Qahtani, who was exposed to abuse that\nMr. Rumsfeld had personally authorized in a memo dated December 2,\n2002; And the former commander of Abu Ghraib, American Janis Karpinski,\nwho said she was \"ready to testify against Donald Rumsfeld as part of\na french criminal investigation. \"\n\nIn France, in the only case so far, the principle of \"universal\njurisdiction\" was invoked in 2005, in sentencing\n an officer of Mauritania (Ely Ould Dah) for acts of torture, after\na trial in absentia before the Cour d'Assises of Nimes. Arrested in 1999\nin Montpellier, where he was on a military training, he was released\nunder judicial supervision, and had the opportunity to flee to Mauritania.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
