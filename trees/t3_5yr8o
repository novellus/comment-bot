You got what you wanted and it's a royal mess. It's resulted in the deaths of millions, the suffering of millions more, a growing economic mess in America, foreign commitments that will extend and cripple America's economy for decades to come, and many of you have lost your loved ones to a war you wholeheartedly endorsed.\n\nGET IT????\"\n\nHopefully the Christians are listening to this very painful lesson, which apparently God's people have been learning and re-learning ever since the children of Israel demanded a king.

He continues his pro-life rhetoric, even though abortions have actually increased a lot since he came into power. The \"enemy,\" the \"evil ones\" are the Islamic terrorists, and it's our Christian duty to uphold our values and kill the enemies. It goes on. But the point is, as long as Christians feel they are culture warriors, and politicians like Bush use the right rhetoric, they'll continue to blindly support them. \n\nChristians obviously, like anyone else, should make informed decisions. For Christians, that will mean ones that reflect Christian values, but it shouldn't be in the name of culture wars, rather it should be justice, equality, and integrity for all.
