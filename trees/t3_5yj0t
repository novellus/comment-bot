I should have said \"will help me scrub my back faster\".\n\nI think a lot of hardcore scientists miss the fact that the scientific method is still useful when used for less important questions by everyday people.  For instance, what if you wrote in your diary every morning for a week, and then wrote in your diary every morning after running for half an hour the next week?  You could determine whether you feel better after exercising.  Strict controls aren't really necessary because the result isn't vital to anything.\n\nFrom *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\":\n\n&gt;...I've never seen a cycle-maintenance problem complex enough really to require full-scale formal scientific method. Repair problems are not that hard. When I think of formal scientific method an image sometimes comes to mind of an enormous juggernaut, a huge bulldozer...slow, tedious lumbering, laborious, but invincible. It takes twice as long, five times as long, maybe a dozen times as long as informal mechanic's techniques, but you know in the end you're going to get it. There's no fault isolation problem in motorcycle maintenance that can stand up to it.

Scientific evidence, to any researcher, implies that the empirical evidence directly supports a hypothesis.\n\nYour example proves that you do not fully understand the concept.  First your hypothesis was that one brush is _better_ than another without any predefined criterion.  Then after the experiment you simply picked one: time to brush, nor did you specify controls (e.g. maybe it was the water temperature or shampoo that caused the issue).\n\nYour flaw is in fact the same as Pear's which explains why they can happily misinform.  A graph or a measurement does not necessarily imply a hypothesis proven.  For all the reader knows the measurements were not even done holding everything else constant.  Maybe the roll-off was due to the measuring equipment (e.g. an impedance issue between the measuring equipment, the cable, and the signal generator), environment, etc.  \n\nMost importantly though, at least it appears that we probably agree they never addressed their hypothesis and thus are only using this empirical evidence to add supposed credibility to their uninformed customers.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "ups": -7, "name": "t1_c029soe", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5yj0t", "retrieved_on": 1427426158, "score_hidden": false, "body": "  That's a good question.  What makes evidence scientific?\n\nI would say that *any* evidence derived using an empirical method counts as \"scientific\".  misterlang complains that the evidence is not scientific because it doesn't provide details about the testing scenario.  I disagree.  It's still scientific evidence, it's just not *rigorous* scientific evidence.\n\nYour example of nonscientific evidence is someone's opinion.  That may qualify as evidence for the purpose of writing \"research papers\" in English class, but it's not scientific because it's not empirically derived.\n\nHere's an example of non-rigorous scientific evidence.  Let's say that I am trying to decide which of two brushes will help me scrub my back better.  On Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday I use Brush A and and on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday I use Brush B.  At the end of the week, I determine that the showers I took using Brush B took an average of two minutes longer.\n\nThere are plenty of flaws in my methodology - but any evidence that I derive is *still scientific* because it was determined empirically.  It's just not very rigorous.  In the hypothetical case I mentioned, I'm wouldn't be terribly concerned.  If you are buying a speaker cable that costs four figures, then you *should* be concerned.\n\nThe thing is, the audiophiles who go to the evidence page are probably planning on buying the cable anyway.  I think the evidence page is mainly a way for them to justify their purchase to their wives.\n\nEdit: I realized there's a big of an ambiguity here, because people often substitute the word \"scientific\" for \"rigorous\", as in \"That evidence isn't very scientific\".  If everyone was using the word \"scientific\" my way, then all evidence would be either scientific or nonscientific.
