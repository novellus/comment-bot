Drop the nit-pick on this, that is the fact.\n\nYour argument comparing abortion to murder misses the point, and you shrug off, sadly, the two reasons why *murder is wrong.*  It ends a life, and removes that life's potential for life experiences.  Of course the person is dead, but we are not rocks.  By your argument, murdering a homeless man that affects no one but that man is not a bad thing.  That is sick.

We should encouraging middle schoolers *not to have sex* because they are not developed, generally, enough to make a responsible decision at this point.  Obviously we need to make contraception available, but there is certainly a valid point in that giving such things out does give a green flag to many children to have sex when they should not be doing so.  That at least needs to be acknowledged.\n\nI fully reject your two choices, because your premise is skewed.\n\nYour two choices *do not take into account* the rights or well-being of the \"fetus\" (I call it a child).  You have yet to provide a good example of why it is not a child.  There is a third option for that couple: not engaging in irresponsible behavior, and that should be the primary (not only) focus.  \n\nI fully believe that abortion is murder (and find your justification disturbing) and you'll probably call me a loony, but I don't believe a couple should have the right to choose murder.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "name": "t1_c02c7ox", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 2, "link_id": "t3_5zcbj", "retrieved_on": 1427424961, "body": "What I don't understand is why you're hung up on the \"unique DNA\" part.  A human being is made up of much more than his or her DNA.\n\nAgain, nitpicky, but identical twins have the exact same DNA... would you be fine with selectively aborting one of them, since that still allows the unique DNA to grow and develop?  Of course you wouldn't.\n\nPeople are not solely defined by their DNA, they are also defined by their knowledge and experiences.  Before cognition, saying that a fetus is a unique person is akin to saying that anything living that has unique DNA is a unique person... no... it has the POTENTIAL for personhood, but so, in fact, does a sperm cell, so, in fact does an egg cell, and so, in fact, may my skin cell.\n\nSo, as you say, is abortion \"right\"?  Well, let us, for the moment, assume that abortion is murder.  Why, then, is murder wrong?  Is it because it harms the individual murdered?  I would argue that is silly.  The direct victim is dead.  The concept of harm is meaningless, since a dead person is dead.  Is it because it robs the person of his potential for further life?  Partially, but still, the person is dead, and you won't hear him complaining.  No, the real reason for murder's wrongness rests on how it effects others.  If a man is murdered, the murderer is punished because the man's wife will never get to talk with him again, his daughter will never have a father to help her grow up, and the man's family will miss him greatly.  This is why, technically, suicide is illegal, and I would say, immoral (except, of course, in the instance of euthanasia, where those loved ones probably want to end the man's suffering as well).\n\nYou aren't harming the fetus by aborting the pregnancy.  It was never conscious, and it never will be.  It has never interacted with the world one bit.  Nobody will miss it, save for the parents, who are making the decision.  The potential for meaningful interactions and relationships in the future is just too far away logically to make it wrong.  If the fetus is developed and cognitive, then it has interacted with the world, the world has interacted with it, and the normal reasons for the wrongness of killing apply.\n\nBiologically, it is not a person.  Socially, it is not a person.  We can keep coming up with counterexamples to everything, but that just detracts from the core issue.\n\nOf course a perfect world would have less abortion.  Sadly, many of the same people that oppose abortion also oppose the best methods we have of decreasing the chance of abortion being one of a set of bad options for an unfit parent and an unwanted child.  If everyone was educated properly about birth control, if idiots didn't get all disgusted about stories like the middle school that prescribes birth control, which is a great step forward (since it is the choice between a 14 year old having sex, or having sex and getting pregnant), then maybe we could have fewer abortions in the country.  You can't fight biology, though, and no form of birth control is perfect.  Accidents will happen.\n\nThen, if the choice ends up being either:\n\n1) Seriously ruining two or more lives, their plans, hopes, and dreams; putting more strain on the system of social support; and giving up those people's potential to have loved and wanted children when they are ready.\n\n2) Aborting a pregnancy before a fetus has the ability to develop relationships and experiences, or to even KNOW that it is alive, simply going from cells dividing to cells not dividing.\n\nThe two people should have the right to choose which of these undesirable paths to take.

It is definitely a step in the right direction.  I am not sure why it wouldn't be just as easy to enforce as a \"third trimester\" law, except that it is possible for some women to not know they are pregnant until it is after 2 weeks obviously.\n\nThe world doesn't *need* more people in your opinion, and frankly most of the world doesn't have cradle-to-grave social services.  We can argue that people don't need them all day I guess, but remember that is certainly an opinion.\n\nThere are plenty of lines that can be drawn definitively.  Conception and birth are two (birth being completely outside the woman's body.)  They are possible, but apparently they are just not convenient.  You know as well as I that without genetic code modifications, a pinky cell would be a clone of you.  There is an abstract line here, and that is of natural reproductive processes.  I don't believe in genetically engineering humans or eugenics, so my whole argument lies within the realm of natural birthing processes.\n\nThe \"most important\" pro-choice point is ridiculous.  It is very similar to saying \"people are going to commit crimes, so we might as well take money from banks and hand it out to would-be criminals\" or \"people are going to commit suicide so we should give them safe and painless lethal injections instead of back-alley methods.\"  The *goal* is to *stop abortions* from happening in the first place.  We should get to the root of the problem which is: why are people having children that don't want them?\n\nThe goal should be solving this problem, and until that day women will have \"back-alley\" abortions, though it is obvious *less* women will have them if it is unsafe and illegal by far.  But the key remains, and you seem to disagree somehow, that a *child is dying for a couple's mistake*.\n\nIt is absolutely silly to me, and nothing here has changed that, to say that it is not a child.  It may be small, it may or may not be cognizant.  But it has unique DNA and is growing and developing.  All of the scientific nit-picks don't change that, and in fact, science only prooves every day that it is more human at earlier stages than we ever thought.\n\nIt may be inconvenient, it may mean there are \"back-alley\" abortions, etc, but that doesn't make abortion *right.*\n\nThat is the issue.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02c728", "id": "c02c7d2", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "ups": 1, "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5zcbj", "retrieved_on": 1427424968, "id": "c02c728", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02c728", "parent_id": "t1_c02c54m", "body": "Response and higher level cognition are two different things... an ant can respond to stimuli, but can it think?\n\nTo be completely honest, a perfect abortion law would be like this:  one has time X (say, two weeks) to choose to terminate or not after a positive test.  This preserves choice, while minimizing the development of aborted fetuses.  Too bad a law like this would be extremely difficult to enforce/implement.  Outside of that, a line has to be drawn, and scientifically, the third trimester line has just as many justifications as any other.\n\nIf it grew to be that fetuses could be gestated completely outside of the womb, then  abortion would just become sort of an \"early adoption\"... the only problem being that the world really doesn't NEED more people in it, and they would be a strain on the social services.\n\nThe point of the little nit-picks is that there is NO line that can be drawn at least somewhat arbitrarily... where would the line be drawn... fertilization?  implantation?  well the blastocyst is just as much a \"unique life\" as the barely developed fetus, so there goes numerous other forms of birth control (IUD) not to mention Plan B.  And with genetic modification and cloning, the cell from my pinky finger that died when I just pressed the shift key could have, in 20 years time, just as much potential to become a unique human life as that blastocyst.\n\nBut, the most important point and reason to be pro-choice is also the simplest.  Making abortion illegal WILL NOT stop abortions.  Women have been terminating pregnancies since the beginning of history, and will continue to do so indefinitely.  It is much better for everyone for it to be a safe medical procedure than a back-alley illegal procedure.\n\nHaving children that you can not or will not support or love is not beneficial to anyone.  The decreased crime which is highly correlated with decriminalization of abortion is a sign of that.  When every child in this country is well educated, well provided for, and loved... when orphanages are empty and adoption agencies are looking for more and more children... then, maybe one could argue that abortion shouldn't take place.
