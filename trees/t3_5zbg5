James Dobson, a major figure in the Religious Right, insists that his staff address married and divorced women by their husband's surname, even if the woman requests otherwise. It's a huge deal for them to define women that way.\n\nI could find a religious extremists opinion on anything and it would be equally ridiculous.  I'm saying that in your daily life if you meet someone and say \"Hi, my name's Barbara Kramer\" they'll say \"Nice to meet you\" as opposed to \"how did you come by the name Kramer?\"  There people out there with last names they invented themselves or took from their mother or a dead grandfather or a step-father or adoptive mother.  It's not something people question on a regular basis, at least not where I'm from.\n\n&gt;You have a source for this? This is the first time I'm ever hearing of such unless the mother is unmarried. This is because in most places the law doesn't allow an ummarried mother to name a man as the father without his consent, so the only available parental surname is the mothers.\n\nI don't, it's why I said \"I believe\".  I was talking about the case of unmarried women of course though.  I have no idea on a state-by-state basis how the birth certificate is done for a married couple who cannot agree on a last name for their child.  If it comes down to needing a law to sort that out I'm guessing a divorce attorney is the next stop anyway.\n\n&gt;And did it ever occur to you that the mother's surname is really just her patrinym?\n\nDid it ever occur to you that when people call you \"Captain Obvious\" it's not a compliment?\n\nFor real, if your ancestors are European you come form a tradition of charting families patrilinealy.  I'm sorry if it bugs you.  Her reason for not just choosing a last name of her own, though is that she might randomly choose a last name of some other male (in her family or otherwise).  If that really bothers her she could pick a last name from one of the African ethnic groups that traditionally trace families matrilineally.  I don't know if that will make her feel better (it shouldn't).\n\n&gt;No one's expecting you to get \"up in arms.\" The article--which you clearly didn't read--is just the woman musing on that part of her life and how things have changed.\n\nYour condescension is heartwarming and penis engorging.
