But no. The correct etymology is fascinating and bizarre. \"Cheque\" is derived from Norman French \"exchequer\", which was roughly the equivalent of the treasury and internal revenue department in England starting around 1300. Why was the internal revenue department called the exchequer? Because it was named after the chessboard, which was also called \"exchequer\".\n\n&gt;What do chessboards have to do with internal revenue? Ah, I am glad you wondered. Hindu-Arabic numerals had not yet become popular in Europe; numbers were still recorded using Roman numerals. It is extremely difficult to calculate efficiently with Roman numerals. How, then did the internal revenue department calculate taxes owed and amounts payable?\n\n&gt;They used an abacus. But it wasn't an abacus like modern Chinese or Japanese abacuses, with beads strung on wires. A medieval European abacus was a table with a raised edge and a grid of squares ruled on it. The columns of squares represented ones, tens, hundreds, and so on. You would put metal counters, called jettons, on the squares to represent numbers. Three jettons on a \"hundred\" square represented three hundred; four jettons on the square to its right represented forty. Each row of squares recorded a separate numeral. To add two numerals together, just take the jettons from one row, move them to the other row, and then resolve the carrying appropriately: Ten jettons on a square can be removed and replaced with a single jetton on the square to the left.\n\n&gt;The internal revenue department, the \"exchequer\", got its name from these counting-boards covered with ruled squares like chessboards.\n\n&gt;(The word \"exchequer\" meaning a chessboard was derived directly from the name of the game: Old French eschecs, Medieval Latin scacci, and so on, all from shah, which means \"king\" in Persian. The word \"checkered\" is also closely related.)\n\n&gt;So, in summary: the game is \"chess\", or eschek in French; the board is therefore exchequer, and since the counting-tables of the treasury department look like chessboards, the treasury department itself becomes known as the exchequer. The treasury department, like all treasury departments, issues notes promising to pay certain sums at certain times, and these notes are called \"exchequer notes\" or just \"exchequers\", later shortened (by the English) to \"cheques\" or (by Americans) to \"checks\". Arabic saqq, if there is such a word, does not come into it. Once again, it is clear that Vallely's research was shoddy.
