It lends that $900 to you, now there is $1000 in nominal money, and the process can go from there (by this logic, the amount of money in the world would explode exponentially out of control!).\n \ntotally wrong.\nwhere would the bank get this magical $900? what bank notes does it place in your hand? there dont exist such bank notes!\nNo, banks do not print money or create money, they only lend money they are holding as deposits.\n \nIn the absolute extreme, with no regulations, no collatoral requirements, a rogue bank taking on tonnes of risk, it would lend out all of the money in its deposits (ie $100), then there would now be $200 in net money. But if i came to the bank asking to withdraw even a single dollar of my deposit, the bank is fucked.\nIn reality there are collatoral requirements, so the bank cannot lend out the entire $100.\n \nWHAT REALLY HAPPENS:\nThe bank has my $100 in its vault, and it has a 1:9 collatoral requirement. Hence it cannot lend out the entire $100, it can only lend out $90, and must keep $10 in its vault to back the loan. So it lends you a maximum of $90, and now there is $190 in net money in existence.\nYou go to another bank with your $90 and deposit it, that bank can then lend out $81 of that in a new loan to someone else, but must keep $9 of that deposit as collatoral, and there is $271 in net money. etc etc.\nAt each step, the money that can be lent is reduced by the 10% collatoral requirement, and a greater and greater portion of the money is sitting un-loanable as collatoral in bank vaults. The maximum that can be achieved is to have the entire amount acting as collatoral, at which point there will be exactly $1000 in net monies held across all bank accounts.\nnote that in reality not all money is re-deposited, so the real multiplier is less than the ratio given by the collatoral requirement.", "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": -1, "parent_id": "t3_1hgtv", "name": "t1_c02bfw4", "author_flair_css_class": null}
