Then he moved on to crack and his life was over. This could happen to rich or poor, as once you get to the crack part, you eventually turn poor anyway because you lose your job, then start selling everything you've got.\n\nI'm saying that there's another, much more common path to hard drugs, which is where people do drugs for escape from their dreary lives. Let's say they're being evicted because their landlord just raised the rent to an unaffordable level. They want to not stress out about it. So they start with a lower drug, such as powdered coke, just like the partier. Then it leads to a habit, then the harder drugs, then the downward spiral.\n\nI'm saying that when someone has nothing to lose, he or she is much more likely to look into the black vortex as an escape. The partying kid with the rich parents and a whole life ahead of him would be somewhat more likely to take a couple of steps back. This is why there's a much larger crack problem in ghettos than in upper-class neighborhoods.\n\nThe solution is find out the cause, the psychological reasons why people do drugs in the first place.

The rush is intense and obliterates your senses, so it doesn't lead to good partying.

I have never seen it on the streets. I admit that I'm a protect white male in a rich neighborhood, but thats my point really.\n\nMaking the drug illegal has in fact keep it out of sight to a degree. Sure you can argue that everyone that looks for it can find it, but what about the casual passerby? If I saw it on the shelf of the local grocery I just might be curious enough to buy it. I wouldn't go out of my way to drive to a bad part of town to get it, but having to pick it up like  aspirin makes the task so much easier.\n\nSo, don't you agree that this form of making drugs illegal, makes it inaccessible to the causal user? Maybe the same argument could be said about assault guns or dynamite? \n\nI think you would have to suggest making them legal, but then putting such high distribution restrictions on them, it would have the same effect of being illegal anyway. Ask anyone if its illegal to have dynamite and they'll say it is, despite dynamite not being illegal.\n\nSo how can we make it legal and not restrict it to the same effect as being illegal?", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "name": "t1_c029ln0", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "ups": 1, "link_id": "t3_5ycpd", "retrieved_on": 1427426250, "id": "c029ln0", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "parent_id": "t1_c029ixu", "body": " (Sorry for deletion, my post got triple-submitted. reddit-2.0 kinks.)\n\nOf course I've seen the deleterious effects of substance abuse - some for legal substances and some for illegal substances.

I have seen it and its not pretty.\n\nYou're suggesting that we as a society not protect people from bad choices and allow them to discover them for themselves. While this sounds noble when combined with the ideal of complete education and acceptance of risk on all subjects, the reality is that it doesn't happen this way.\n\nThe most people are educated on the subject of drugs is very little and amounts to abstinence.
