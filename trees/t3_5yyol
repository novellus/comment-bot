I thought he was a very intelligent man. I was quite impressed with him. I did have a problem with his repeated claim to know the \u201cframers\u2019 intent.\u201d I have no problem with judges who go by the letter of the law. That\u2019s fine. I DO have a problem with judges who claim that they can mystically divine the \u201cframers\u2019 intent\u201d based on extra-constitutional writings. I think it is worthwhile to investigate the other writings of the framers to try to understand what they might have meant by various passages in the constitution so long as you admit the word \u201cmight.\u201d No one \u2013 not Bork \u2013 not me \u2013 can \u201cknow\u201d the framers\u2019 intent \u2013 they\u2019re dead. And if you believe you\u2019re interpretation is the one and only true interpretation of the framers\u2019 intent, you are a fundamentalist. No different than a street corner preacher who is convinced that his interpretation of the Bible is true and all others are of Satan. I ran into the same thing in college with people who were convinced that they alone knew the \u201cauthor\u2019s intent\u201d of a particular work and all other interpretations were hogwash. They were fundamentalists, too. No different than Reverend Jehoshaphat Hatfield proclaiming all who fail to see things his way are damned to torment in the Lake of Fire. So while I initially liked this article, it quickly turned into a pity party for Bork not getting into the SCOTUS and cheerleading session for those who \u201cknow\u201d the framers\u2019 intent want you to see the light of their messiah, too.
