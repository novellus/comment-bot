It suffices to allocate it elsewhere and basically deliberately leak the block that is defective. It wouldn't take a whole lot of file-system code to do that.\n\nThen you can say, \"Put the drive in this mode,\" and you've got a drive with 20 percent more capacity and 20 percent higher bandwidth because you're running ZFS on top of it.
