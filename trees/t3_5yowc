The problem is, the Kurds want their nation-state and are willing to fight both Iran and Turkey to get it.\n\nI worry about the Kurds.  Either they are going to be repressed by Turkey and Iran for the foreseeable future, or the international community will step in and try to negotiate a partition as it did in the former Yugoslavia (which created Bosnia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Macedonia.)\n\nThe region of southern Turkey, north western Iran and northern Iraq is pretty much Kurdish.  It's going to be a problem for a long time to come.\n\nIt was the Kurdish drive to independence that led Saddam to \"attack his own people\" (to use a pre-Iraq war phrase.)  This independence streak still exists and it is now leading for Turkey and Iran to get involved.  Saddam wasn't a great guy, but the issues he dealt with in his reign with haven't magically gone away, these issues are endemic to the region.
