The only problem: the video was fake. Again, we've had Cheny confessing that [Osama Bin Laden was not behind 9/11](http://reddit.com/info/28g4c/comments). That was bullshit.\n\nThen, around 370 redditors voted up this bullshit to front page: [Bush gave $43 million to Taliban 4 months before 9/11 ](http://reddit.com/info/26d3p/comments). Again, we've had a sensationalist front page story telling us that the [FBI is Contacting More Than One Million PC Owners](http://reddit.com/info/1zacy/comments)_, while the [actual](http://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel07/botnet061307.htm) reality was much different.\n\nSome time ago, we had a story [making fun of PHP](http://programming.reddit.com/info/2ywu8/comments), while in fact, the code was a bad programmer's hack, that had nothing to do with PHP as a programming language.\n\nI remember once we had a #1 story with a title like \"What? Jews can't be terrorists? They're \"bombers\"? (I can't find the story now, it seems the submitter deleted it, but here is a [parody submission](http://reddit.com/info/20afb/comments/)). The story was about media using a Jewish guy caught by _Israeli_ police for planning to disrupt an _Israeli_ procession with crude bombs. The submitter and the commentators kept on ranting about how media is biased towards Israel, because the news story was titled \"bomber arrested in Israel\". All those who pointed out that [this terminology](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3395973.stm) is also used for Hamas militants got modded down. Then we had a [story](http://reddit.com/info/1lnux/comments) claiming that Isarel intentionally attacked an American ship killing innocent soldiers. While, in fact, multiple inquiries by both the governments concluded that it was an accidental attack for which Isarel apologized later.\n\nThen we've reddit users saying that Wikipedia admins are [deleting](http://science.reddit.com/info/5z8ec/comments/c02bnq6) the science-related articles to make way for Star Trek articles. While in fact, they're just trying to merge the article on \"_In Event of Moon Disaster_\" into article on Apollo, and moving the actual text of the speech to their sister project [Wiki source](http://wikisource.org/wiki/Main_Page), which is meant for that purpose. But, comments saying \"worst deletion EVER\", \"veteran dickheads will immediately void your vote\", \"In other words: Fuck off\", \"knowledge-inhibiting deletionists\" will get modded up.\n\nIf you want to get your story or comment voted up, here's the formula:\n\n* say US soldiers raped or tortured an Iraqis (of course, you can ignore the photos showing a U.S. soldier playing with an Iraqi boy or caressing an Iraqi baby)\n\n* say U.S. is a police state and Feds are out to get anybody who opposes the administration (you can even say that FBI and the CIA staged the Hurricane Katrina)\n\n* praise Haskell and LISP are great, while Java, PHP and ASP.NET suck (yes, you can pretend that no good programmer uses Java, PHP and ASP.NET)\n\n* say \"media finally accepts Ron Paul is a serious, popular candidate\" (while 70% of the Americans don't know anything about Ron Paul).\n\n* say Israel is evil (no, it doesn't matter that majority of the Israelis are peace-loving and they themselves have suffered a lot)\n\n* say all Wikipedia admins are deletionists who are censoring the truth and deleting the articles that are not about Star Trek (again, you can overlook the fact that 90% of the 1000 Wikipedia admins have a clean record, and they've been _elected_ by rest of the Wikipedians for showing dedication tot the project)\n\n\nIn short, we redditors make fun of Digg users, but actually we're in the same league as them.
