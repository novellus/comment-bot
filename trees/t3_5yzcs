What I was trying to point out was that reddit is in DIRE need of some bad press regarding Ron.\n\nSince I've been on reddit (Read; \"since there's been a reddit\") I've been following the general consensus here with the same amount of attention any other more-or-less interested redditor would.\n\nI can safely assert that the average, active user here holds political opinions more or less in keeping with my own on most topics (save conspiracy theories and other assorted minutia) and I therefore find this whole _\"Ron Paul is Like A Puppy-Scented Moses Christ - Now With %0 Trans Fat!\"_ vibe going on here to be a bit ridiculous.\n\nThe guy considers abortion to be murder (And would like to see Roe overturned), would like to stop federal funding for public education, has a voting record that borders on fellatio whereever certain key industries are concerned, would rather see the third world burn than send US forces in peacekeeping roles or within the UN (And I mean Rwanda, Kosovo and Darfur, not Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran). Hell, speaking of the UN, he wants to see the whole organization essentially dismantled.\n\nHe's a loony-toon and what's worse; He's the absolute epitome of the one political stereotype that is more appalling, pathetic and disturbing than any other, bar none; A Constitutional Absolutist.\n\nThis, more than anything else proves he's a whackjob. It's the political equivalent of young-earth creationism. Dr. Paul basically believes the framers of the constitution to be infallible and votes _exclusively according to his interpretation of what learned men in 1776 would vote..._ The guy is steadfast and consistent, granted, but if I, as the newly elected leader of the United Kingdom - for example - decided to depart from modern law and  operate exclusively within the strict guidelines of the Magna Carta then you'd all think I was insane. Somehow, Ron Paul's adherence to a document just as dated doesn't phase anyone...\n\nAnyways, fuck this. I'm done venting. I could bitch and moan for hours but this just doesn't interest me enough.
