A political system in which the individual has the FREEDOM to exercise political choice.  \n\nWhat is Capitalism?  An economic system in which the individual has the FREEDOM to exercise economic choice.\n\nBecause of this shocking similarity, Reich must go through some mental gymnastics in order to conflate a conflict in which democracy (good) is being destroyed by capitalism (bad). \n\nHe uses a few tricks, among which is the introduction of the idea that Democracy is _supposed_ to be a fair system for everyone in terms of social justice or economic justice (defined in the progressive sense of equality being the end point that we may use to judge whether \"democracy\" is happening).  \n\nIn fact, Democracy is simply a procedure that allows for a controlled, non-bloody revolution to occur on a scheduled basis.  In the US, they happen about every 2 years.  We bang political drums, accuse the other side of behaving like a scoundrel, get angry, passionate, etc., but the process keeps everybody alive to duke it out again a few years later.\n\nIn places where democracy doesn't exist, things proceed in a seemingly smooth manner for years at a time and then suddenly there is a military coup or a violent revolution, etc.\n\nWe are fortunate that our constitution has some nice features that require a super majority for \"big\" things, and we have term limits that prevent charismatic leaders from gaining the kind of foothold that they might gain elsewhere.\n\nAll in all, democracy is a process rather than an end in itself.  Sure we can make things more fair by improving ballot counting and outreach, and as the internet becomes a larger portion of the advertising pie, blogs, etc., will become a far more influential platform, and unlike a 30 second spot on NBC, they are free for anyone who cares to write one.\n\nThe other technique Reich uses is to conflate capitalism with crony capitalism and entrenched business interests.  \n\nCapitalism is simply a process as well... Unlike socialism where individual choice is constrained, capitalism allows the average schmo to buy and sell nearly anything he wants for whatever price he thinks is fair. \n\nBUT, there are increasing signs that we are moving away from Capitalism.  For instance, why should any company need to hire lawyers to make friends with elected officials rather than simply creating the best products and services that they can?  Sadly our elected officials enjoy the power to dole out tax relief and other handouts to businesses.  \n\nThe conventional wisdom is that businesses should pay higher taxes, but suppose business taxes were eliminated and instead shareholders had to pay income tax on the proceeds rather than capital gains tax.  We'd see the power of elected officials to dole out favors drastically diminished.  \n\nCapitalism is about change.  If a company runs into a crunch and needs to lay off 1000 workers, that is a very abrupt change.  But sometimes that sort of thing must be done.  Those who oppose capitalism suggest that firms should not be allowed to let those workers go.  Instead, they argue, firms should have to keep those people on the payroll.  If you take this to the extreme then you end up with firms who avoid hiring people for fear of not being able to have the flexibility to let them go if business conditions change.  Similarly, employees should be able to quit, no questions asked, if they want to.\n\nSo capitalism is freedom and change.  Anyone who wants to hamper capitalism is necessarily arguing for less freedom and less change.\n\nTake the airlines and companies like GM who want bailouts.  They are arguing for less change.\n\nTake the firms who oppose allowing free trade with China... they oppose freedom because they anticipate that it will bring change.\n\nImagine the Blacksmith working in a shop pounding out horse shoes all day long.  Without change (cars, mass transit) he'd still have a job.  Without freedom, we'd still have to use horse drawn carriages.\n\nThis can be applied to any industry.  The blacksmith example is a long enough time frame that it seems absurd.  But consider that if we limit freedom and change in pharmaceutical research (as in single payer healthcare) then we may be using 2007 medicine in 2020 and not even realize it.\n\nOf course, we need some regulation but proper regulation increases freedom and increases the possibility for change rather than decreasing either.  For example, environmental regulation that preserves the usability of land even if a polluting factory closes, increases the possibility for change b/c it allows the land to avoid being forever damaged.  \n\nThe big struggles today to preserve the freedom and fairness of capitalism are the struggle against regulators who wish to create the opportunity to modify rules to dole out handouts in exchange for political contributions.  Every dollar spent by firms on lobbying is a dollar that can't go into advertising or R&amp;D and makes all of us worse off.\n\n\n", "author_flair_css_class": null}
