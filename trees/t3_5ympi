Having the safe injection site means:\n\n* People aren't sharing needles. AIDS is a big problem in the downtown east-side; this will help slow the rate of infection.\n* If someone overdoses, they have immediate medical attention available.\n* Opportunities for nurses and social workers to discuss treatment options and programs with addicts.\n* Needles are safely disposed of in biohazard containers, not left on the street.\n* A clean, safe environment to shoot up in, instead of under a bridge, in an alley, or an abandoned lot.\n\nThe injection site isn't a solution to the problem of drug addiction; but it's part of the strategy of *harm reduction*. Deal with the immediate day-to-day problem of dirty/shared needles, overdoses, etc.\n\nFor anyone interested in learning more about Vancouver's: http://www.vch.ca/sis/\n\n ", "author": "sylvan", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "id": "c02a0n2", "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c02a0n2", "parent_id": "t1_c029zfz", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 2, "name": "t1_c029zfz", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5ympi", "retrieved_on": 1427426071, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c029zfz", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5ympi", "body": "They do this in Vancouver B.C. near gastown.
