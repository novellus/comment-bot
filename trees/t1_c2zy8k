It was a response to a question I did not ask.  The fact that you are not capable of accepting this is pathetic.\n\nAs to your second comment, you refuse to even say what you are objecting to: that I can recognize intelligence; that intelligence is recognizable; that intelligence is important; that intelligence exists; or any of the dozen other possibilities.\n\nI am sorry that you cannot deal with my responses to you.  It does seem that you are mostly bluster as I suspected, and as I have found most people with such erratic reasoning skills, poor manners, and arrogance as you demonstrated.\n\nRegardless, I believe most people can recognize those people who can \"see around corners\" that they cannot, recognize those people who can out-think them.  For all of your bluster, you have demonstrated nothing except some knowledge of Bloom's taxonomy, unlimited arrogance, and a thin skin.  \n\nYou have repeatedly used the narrowest and most particular definitions of words as if they are the only usage.\n\nMy overall point is this: you have not demonstrated average, let alone exceptional, knowledge, comprehension, solutions, analysis, imagination, or judgment.  Your judgment seems poorest of all.\n\nBut, as I said above: I am sure you will develop more as you get older.  As long as you are not too arrogant.\n\nIf this was a battle of wits, wills, knowledge, analysis, creativity, comprehension, or evaluation, I have clearly whooped your ass.  \n\nAnd I graciously accept your implicit concession.", "author": "babblingpoet", "created_utc": "1192722197", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "politics", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_c029uut", "id": "c029vrn", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "politics", "ups": 1, "name": "t1_c029uut", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_2zs10", "retrieved_on": 1427426130, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c029uut", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c029sdq", "body": "&gt; First, you clearly did not understand the single question of mine that you answered here.\n\nYou bore me.

But your response does get points for pithiness.  A few points must be deduced for  reading comprehension though.\n\nSecond, as for your point about my confusing empathy and sympathy: I did not.  You clearly lack an understanding of one of the keys qualities by which you seek to disenfranchise or exterminate people with.  Your anti-definition of empathy is incorrect.  Empathy is commonly defined as \"understanding and entering into another's feelings\", or some close variation.  It is a translation of the German term einf\u00fchlung meaning the state of being \u2018in tune with\u2019 another person.  You take a colder view of the word - suggesting it does not suggest any connection, any caring.  Based on the definition and etymology, you are clearly wrong.\n\nEven if you choose to define empathy in whatever manner you please, it seems a tad irrational to consider murder for the sake of amusement to be an altruistic impulse.\n\nAnd you yourself seem to have confused the your definition of empathy and the world's in your first statement: \n\"One does not need to employ empathy all of the time and be some kind of self-sacrificing self-flagellating martyr.\"\nWhat about \"understand[ing] people's inner selves, yet also not giv[ing] a rat's ass\" would lead one to self-sacrifice?  \n\nI will take your invocation of a \"self-flagellating martyr\"  as an beautifully irrational burst of poetry at the end of a statement in which you use the word empathy correctly.\n\nFinally, when you were willing to respond to my initial questions I was impressed with your answers, despite the inconsistencies.  Your response was unique and showed some real flair and intelligence.  But as the game has apparently become less fun and a bit more challenging, you seem to be opting out.  You seem not to grasp what I believe is one of the defining experiential problems of all-time, and especially our own: the essential other-ness of others.\n\nIn my life, I have always been able to recognize those people who are more intelligent or more skilled than I am.  Sometimes, my acknowledgment has been grudging and private, but I have always known.  Although my sample of your thought is limited, it seems clear you are not.  At the very least, you have deluded yourself into believing your thoughts are somehow beyond ordinary comprehension.  Or perhaps, you are just playing a game.  Either way, I am disappointed.  \n\nBut perhaps, after you graduate high school - as valedictorian I hope, you'll be able to experience a wider range of the world and perhaps you'll be less concerned about unique viewpoints and more concerned about correct ones.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
