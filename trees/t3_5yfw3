At that point, the fact that the woman was a prostitute became immaterial.", "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c029ln6", "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": "t1_c029ljc", "name": "t1_c029ln6", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "score_hidden": false, "ups": -2, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5yfw3", "retrieved_on": 1427426251, "id": "c029ljc", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c029ljc", "parent_id": "t3_5yfw3", "body": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null}
