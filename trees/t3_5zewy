But I worry that you're serious, so I'll go ahead and respond.\n\nThe \"They didn't get pregnant, did they?\" line was written as though it were the response of an administrator at my former school.  Of course men can't get pregnant, but this is exactly why it is so unjust and misogynistic to have a policy that punishes pregnancy and not sex.  If you wanted to stand a stand against all sexual activity, then you ought to banish the father of the child as well (it was well known who the father was).  To demand that the woman leave, as though it were the pregnancy and not the act that spawned it that was sinful, is not only cruel, but contrary to the tenements of Christian ethics - forgiveness, embracing life, rejecting abortion.  A girl who has made a choice to deliver a baby because of the ethics you have taught her ought to be embraced and supported by the community, not banished and shunned.\n\nThis was not an isolated instance at my school, by the way.  We had a teacher get fired because a student found a picture online - what looked to be a scanned polaroid, likely taken by an ex-boyfriend - of her naked.  The teacher was immediately fired, the student body told of what had happened, her reputation tarnished.  The student, who had not only found the picture surfing the internet for pornography, but also distributed it to several other students - in the middle of computer class - received absolutely no punishment whatsoever.  Not a teacher even bothered to talk to him about it.  The subtext of all this is that for a women to be naked is a sin, deserving swift punishment - while, for a man to lust after a naked woman is natural, deserving understanding.\n\nIt isn't the natural differences between men and women that I'm objecting to (how could I?).
