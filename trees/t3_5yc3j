But if people had real choice over ISPs, then they could switch to ISPs that voluntarily preserve net neutrality. The biggest problem is that governments have intentionally through legislation created monopolies on cable and telephone services, giving most people only one or two reasonable choices of ISPs. Thus achieving voluntary net neutrality requires not federal legislation, but repealing laws making it illegal to compete with the local phone and cable companies. Wireless competition is coming slowly - unless the FCC screws that up.

When you said net neutrality was about \"having internet access\" I kind of assumed you didn't know what you were talking about.\n\nThat being said, I don't think net neutrality is simply a bandage for barriers to competition. Even in a competitive free market, net neutrality would not flourish. It's more like artificially forcing the net to be a level playing field; in a free market most users would pay a little less for lower QoS, and some users would pay much more for higher QoS. Most people would be happy with slightly cheaper internet access, until somebody tries to start a web business. They'll realize that if they want to compete, they have to pay much more.\n\nIn that way, net neutrality is a bulwark against web monopolies. It also protects free speech. Without the ability to publish their own material, common users would lose ground to corporations in web content. Nonprofit websites wouldn't be able to raise the money for their increased fees. The web would become like television - a medium dominated by big businesses. Another aspect of net neutrality that is often overlooked is the prevention of ISPs from blocking certain sites and protocols. The importance of that is pretty obvious.\n\nAnd remember: it's the corporate lobbyists who are pushing against net neutrality. This isn't a bandage for that problem, but it would be a failure in that area to give in.

So that's not a terribly illustrative example.\n\nYour point is accurate: a strategic air attack is usually *considered* an act of war. The Constitution, however, says nothing about this matter. The words \"act of war\" do not appear in that document. The sum total of its language that we're arguing about is in Article 1, Section 8:\n\n&gt; The Congress shall have Power... To declare War...\n\nThat's it.\n\nWe're talking about the power to *declare* a state of war. Not to wage it, not to order specific attacks, not to command troops. Just to declare that a state of war exists.\n\nNowhere does the Constitution say that the president (who \"shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States\") has to go to Congress to get permission to use that Army and Navy to attack a target, whether or not a declaration of war has been issued.\n\nMaybe you're under the misimpression that the military can't use force unless Congress issues a formal declaration of war. You're welcome to try to back that up with a citation. Presidents have been ordering the U.S. military to point its guns without a declaration of war almost since the Constitution was ratified. \n\nAnd even if air strikes were a power granted only to Congress, it wouldn't matter, since Congress ceded this right to the President in 1973 (with conditions). Go read the [War Powers Act](http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/warpower.htm):\n\n&gt; The President **in every possible instance** shall **consult** with Congress before introducing United States Armed Forces into hostilities...\n\n&gt; In the absence of a declaration of war, in any case in which United States Armed Forces are introduced into hostilities... the president shall submit within 48 hours to [Congress]... a report, in writing...\n\n&gt; Within sixty calendar days after a report is submitted... the President shall terminate any use of United States Armed Forces ... unless the Congress has declared war...\n\nCongress has given the president a 60-day \"bomb anything you want\" card. S/he is *requested* to consult Congress ahead of time but it is explicitly *not* required. S/he is required to write a report (\"what I did on my bombing vacation\"). There are a few other minor conditions.\n\nBut there is no question about it: the president is fully authorized to attack targets in Iran, and if the lawyers and generals say it's not \"possible\" to consult with Congress ahead of time, s/he doesn't have to.\n\nAgain, Romney is right, and Paul is wrong.
