I much rather give the money to someone I know needs it (or get what they need).\n\nThere was once this fellow on the street (this happened in Tijuana while I was taking a walk downtown with my family), with a small girl in his arms, she looked very sick; his face was that of despair, and the little girl looked very bad. He was on the floor, legs crossed, girl in arms, and in one hand, a prescription note (he was in front of a drug store), the note stated the girl needed an antibiotic which was somewhat expensive; I took the prescription, purchased the medicine and a bottle of water, gave them to the guy along with his prescription. A tear came from his eyes and barely said thanks, I smiled and walked away as he quickly gave the girl the medicine and water.\n\nFew days later while I was doing some errands in the same area, I saw another person in a similar situation, I took the prescription note and noticed this other guy looked up at me and demanded money! I offered to buy the medicine for the kid, but in this case the fucker was only trying to swindle people by making the kid play sick.\n\nThat is why I don't trust people with my money.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
