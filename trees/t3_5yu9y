I gave anecdotal examples of them doing so. You then countered that its wrong for anyone to claim they're roman catholic and they're uneducated if they do. I tried to enlighten you on what its like to be a roman catholic, before I finally realized you weren't taking issue with the religious group commonly called roman catholics, but rather that they can only be called roman while in rome and otherwise are supposed to be calling themselves catholic.\n\nThat is pure semantics. You attempted to throw in pedantic details along the way that bore no relevance to the discussion, but I tried to keep the discussion focused on the common usage of the term roman catholic.\n\nYou're right and I actually learned something about the term \"roman catholic\". However you're still wrong that there aren't any \"roman catholics\" outside of rome in a colloquial sense.\n\n&gt; so you've redefined \"arrogance\" as \"excessive desire for preciseness.\"\n\nNo, the arrogance you show is when you equate your knowledge of details in catholic terminology to be \"educated\" and fortunate. While at the same time it implies that myself (and the lady in the photo) are unfortunates to be falling outside catholic teachings.\n\nSo actually if I was to have redefined \"arrogant\", I would have chosen \"self-righteous\" instead.\n\n&gt; Not all correction is \"looking down\" at the one being corrected.\n\nyou can try to wiggle out of it, but the use of unfortunate was very clear in the context it was used and your arrogant attitude in the follow-up comments has only verified it further in my mind.\n\n&gt; I don't think you're really qualified\n\nthis comment here simply further confirms my analysis. I take it you feel like that there is someone that indeed is qualified to analyze your experience and your religiosity. You just feel that I am not qualified because I am not as well read in the mythos and doctrines of the catholic church. \n\nI suppose you can take this final analysis and use it as a yardstick to gauge the accuracy of my other impressions about you.\n\n&gt; if you feel like reading more.\n\nI think we've beat the discussion of roman catholics outside of rome to death now, but again I thank you and I have enjoyed this discussion (hard for me to believe myself) and I will in fact read your journal later tonight.", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c02awbz", "parent_id": "t1_c02aump", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c02aump", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 1, "link_id": "t3_5yu9y", "retrieved_on": 1427425666, "body": "&gt; Your arrogance abounds in this post.\n\nNot really.\n\n&gt; First, you're trying to claim that you never said what I quoted you\n\nFirst, to be clear: as far as I can tell, you aren't quoting me, you're largely discusing what my comments \"suggest.\"\n\n&gt; you're trying to change what you meant by it\n\nI don't have to do that.

You'll notice that you wrote unfortunately and this word means that there was a turn of events for the worse.\n\nYes, I did.  It's always unfortunate when people claim to be one thing and act a different thing.  Hypocrisy is always and everywhere unfortunate, and that's exactly what I was lamenting in my original statement: that **unfortunately** there are a great many Catholics who openly claim to be Catholic and yet do not *act* Catholic.\n\n&gt; What you think is being pedantic really isn't. Pedantry is details and not semantic word games.\n\nBah.  Do you have to argue about *everything*?  Pedantry is being excessively worried about details.  This whole conversation has been an exercise in it.  There have not been \"semantic word games\": our argument has been about the *meaning* of the term \"Roman Catholic,\" and how it's inapplicable to most Latin rite Catholics and how the well-educated, careful ones wouldn't use the term: all relatively minor details.\n\n&gt; So what you don't realize you're doing is showing your arrogance.\n\nAh, so you've redefined \"arrogance\" as \"excessive desire for preciseness.\"  In that case, I suppose I can agree.\n\n&gt; You look down at others faith as being less than yours\n\nYou have no real measure by which to determine that I'm doing such, particularly because it's the fact that I'm *not* doing it.

In fact, it suggests quite the opposite: that I have a great deal of practical experience with the Church, especially in America, and can honestly say, from experience, that many less educated and less careful Catholics don't abide by the teachings of their Church.\n\n&gt; It seems rather arrogant to me to say that anyone using the term Roman Catholic is either uneducated or careless, because it would suggest you're reading a static definition out of a book (or off a website) and then trying to shove theists into this definition.\n\nNo, I'm basing my definition of the *history of the use of the term*.\n\n&gt; Then you went on to suggest that anyone's actions outside the official papal decree is an unfortunate occurrence.\n\nAgain, I made no such suggestion.  I must question your reading skills if you actually believe what you're saying at this point.\n\n&gt; Presumably this is unfortunate because they wouldn't be a true (roman) catholic anymore, which leads to the notion that they're wrong and going to hell.\n\nYou really don't have any idea of what you're talking about, clearly.  Please stop making claims about a Church you clearly no little about.  Dissident Catholics (educated or uneducated) remain Catholic regardless of their disobedience.  Heck, even excommunicated Catholics are *still Catholic*.  The only way to cease to be Catholic is to formally apply to your bishop and ask permission to defect from the Church.\n\nBut again, that's neither here nor there, it's just another example of imprecision and/or erroneousness in your claims about the Church.\n\n&gt; In essence your claim is that this woman holding the sign is uneducated on her own religion.\n\nClearly she is.  My initial post in this thread was from the authoritative Catechism of the Catholic Church, which flatly contradicts her purported claim.\n\n&gt; Then you're leveling the same criticism against me, that because my personal experience was similar to this ladies, I'm also uneducated.\n\nWhich you deserve, based on your claims made in this thread (even in this very post) alone.\n\n&gt; The thing that strikes me is that you've lost the point of religion though in moving forward with this line of reasoning and thats why you appeared to have no practical experience in being a catholic.\n\nI would argue more forcefully against this statement if it were actually coherent, but since it isn't, I'll just make a small statement: nothing I've said or done has in any way \"lost the point of religion.\"  Religion is about the search for truth, and the pursuit of truth requires that a person speak accurately and carefully.  My pedantry may seem excessive, but it's motivated by the very motivation that makes me religious in the first place.\n\n&gt; I wondered why you dug so far into catholicism though?\n\nI was raised Protestant, and chose to become Catholic after much investigation into the claims made both by the various branches of Protestantism (most deeply the one I was raised in, the [Restoration movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restoration_movement)) and the claims made by the Catholic Church.  The claims of the Catholic Church were simply more logically and historically coherent than the claims made by the various Protestant sects.  I could go into far more detail, of course, but I'm not sure you want the whole essay.  In short, *Sola Scriptura*, the formal principle of the Reformation and the basic premise from which Protestant doctrine flows, is logically incoherent and self-defeating: for it to be of any practical use, it depends on premises that contradict it.\n\n&gt; So if its not too personal, why have you chosen catholicism or have you gone in depth with many other religions as well?\n\nI examined all the major Christian sects, including most Protestant groups, the various Orthodox Churches, and the Catholic Church.  I didn't look into non-Christian religions in large part because they don't seem to reasonably account for the person of Jesus Christ, the fundamental doctrine of Christianity that elevates it above the milieu of human religions.\n\n&gt; I ask this because it almost appears that you're a theistic believer in your level of knowledge and yet you seem to lack the underlying nature of a believer. \n\nI'm curious what you consider to be the \"underlying nature of a believer\" that I'm lacking.  The history of the Church is *replete* with major issues over what might appear, to an outsider, to be unimportant.  The first two ecumenical councils, for instance, were largely held to resolve the issue of which word should be used to describe Jesus: *homoousias* or *homoiousias*--a difference on only one *letter*.  The next council was held over whether Mary is properly described as the *theotokos* or the *christotokos*--again, a battle over a single word.\n\nChrist said to the woman at the well, \"God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.\"  The underlying nature of a believer is not merely a spiritual, emotional irrationality, but necessarily includes a rational devotion to truth.  To quote from John Paul II's encyclical *Fides et Ratio* (Faith and Reason):\n\n&gt;&gt; Faith and reason are like two wings on which the human spirit rises to the contemplation of truth; and God has placed in the human heart a desire to know the truth\u2014in a word, to know himself\u2014so that, by knowing and loving God, men and women may also come to the fullness of truth about themselves.\n\nFaith and reason are not enemies.\n\n&gt; Perhaps it's simply your job/hobby and this explains the detachment or maybe it's because you started as an adult?\n\nIt's not detachment, it's just topicality.  I can't provide people with faith; only God can do that.  I can, however, speak truth, and give rational reasons for what I believe, with the goal of removing intellectual stumbling blocks to faith.  Telling you what I believe rarely matters; telling you why I believe what I believe is far more important.\n\n\"Come now, let us reason together, says the LORD\" (Isaiah 1:18)", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "parent_id": "t1_c02asn5", "id": "c02atxr", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "ups": 1, "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5yu9y", "retrieved_on": 1427425692, "body": "   &gt; You might find the less educated or less careful Catholics using the term, but you'll find such Catholics doing a lot of things that aren't in accordance with what the official line, unfortunately.\n\nthis is the statement that suggested you had no practical experience with the church.

I have a growing library of Catholic literature.  I read papal encyclicals for the fun of it.  I post regularly on Catholic forums.  I've interacted with a great many educated and uneducated Catholics.  I'm fairly qualified to say that the educated, careful ones understand the issues behind the term \"Roman Catholic\" and don't frequently use it to refer to themselves.  My example of the Vatican's website is that it hosts content developed by highly educated, very careful Catholics and you will never--not one single time find them refer to the Church as \"The Roman Catholic Church.\"\n\n&gt; Don't you think that maybe you should back up these single source of information with another source written by another author or at least some anecdotal evidence?\n\nAnecdotal evidence?  Read the tracts of St. Francis de Sales, a doctor of the Church.  Not once does he refer to it as \"The Roman Catholic Church.\"  Read the writings of St. Augustine or St. Thomas Aquinas, both (again) doctors of the Church: *nowhere* will you find them refer to it as \"The Roman Catholic Church.\"  Why not?  **Because that's not what the Church calls itself**.  Educated Catholics know this.  Educated, careful Catholics don't call themselves \"Roman Catholic\" because of this.\n\n&gt; I think this is a common position taken by many after they read a webpage. \n\nYou completely missed the pont of my reference to the Vatican's website.\n\n&gt; I'm just telling you how catholic doctrine was taught to me and the nicene creed is a pledge to follow the orders given out by the church.\n\nThe Nicene Creed begins *Credo*--\"I believe.\"  It's not a pledge of obedience; it's not a pledge at all, but an affirmation of the fundamental doctrines held by the Church.\n\n&gt; The \"apostolic church\" part means that the order of priest to bishop to cardinal to pope is the accepted hierarchy within the church.\n\nNo, the \"apostolic\" mark of the Church means that it has its authority derived in direct succession from the Apostles.  It's not talking about the hierarchy (which you've got slightly wrong, but that's not really relevant here), but the apostolic nature of the Church.\n\n&gt; If you have an alternate theory as to how the authority of catholic church is pledged, I'd be glad to hear it.\n\nYou're the one making the claim that such a pledge exists; you're responsible for defending such a claim.  I've reviewed the sacrament of confirmation and it's not there.\n\n&gt; Where are you getting that the use of \"roman catholic\" is incorrect and yet \"latin rite\" is correct?\n\nBecause that's how the Church speaks.  Roman Catholics are those Catholics who live and worship in Rome.  The Church of Rome is the particular Catholic Church located in Rome.  For most large metropolitan areas, it would be accurate to say \"The Church of ...\"--there's a Church of Boston, a Church of Los Angeles, etc.  Early in the Church there were five major sees: the Church of Rome, the Church of Constantinople, the Church of Antioch, the Church of Alexandria, and the Church of Jerusalem.  But the whole Church, the Church that convened at councils, that was the **Catholic** Church.  Not the Roman Catholic Church, not the Alexandrian Catholic Church, just the Catholic Church.  And that's the name the Church still uses for itself.\n\nFor examples of the use of the term \"Latin Rite,\" just look at the very first canon in the Code of Canon Law: \"The canons of this Code regard only the Latin Church.\"  Look at any of the sacrament sections of the Catechism: when it talks about the ordinary minister and form of the sacrament (something that differs between rites), it always specifies, \"In the Latin Rite...\"\n\nI'm really not making this stuff up.\n\n&gt; If you want to argue semantics\n\nWe are not, and have never been, discussing semantics.  You can't just pull phrases out of your hat when you don't have an argument :)  \"To argue semantics\" has a meaning (coincidentally, to argue about the meanings of words), one that this conversation does not fulfill.\n\n&gt; I thought we were merely arguing about the use of the term Roman Catholic by people to refer to themselves and whether they were educated in the ways of the church or not?\n\nAnd we are.  That's why I've consistently made and supported the claim that only uneducated or careless Latin Rite Catholics would refer to themselves as \"Roman Catholics.\"  It's a pejorative term invented only a few centuries ago.\n\n&gt; I claimed that being roman catholic means you submit to all the dictates of the pope in rome.\n\nAnd you're wrong.  Being a Roman Catholic means you're a Catholic who worship in the Church of Rome.  A great many non-Roman Catholics, Latin Rite or otherwise, submit to the authority of the pope in Rome.\n\n&gt; I'm sorry you feel its ridiculous, but I'm just trying to help you understand what it means when people say they are roman catholic and that they aren't stupid for saying it.\n\nYou're not helping me understand anything; I think it's clear that my Catholic education (all of which I received as an adult, incidentally, since I became Catholic as an adult) was both more thorough and more accurate than yours.  *I'm* trying to help *you* understand that the use of the term \"Roman Catholic\" by your average, run-of-the-mill, largely uneducated and certainly careless Catholic is inaccurate.\n\n&gt; I'm not sure what you're driving at with this. Are you saying that she doesn't think she is roman catholic and is lying? Or she is simply stupid for believing her religion is the correct one?\n\nSince neither of those potential interpretations has anything whatsoever to do with what I actually said, I'm going to send you back to the drawing board on that one.

That God humanized Himself (by becoming fully man in Jesus Christ) is the foundation of our religion, and it's what differentiates us from every other monotheistic religion.  It's not *I* who've humanized God; it is God who humanized Himself so that I could more fully understand Him.  I think it was A.W.
