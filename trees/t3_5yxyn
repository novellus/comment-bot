All evidence says 4.5 Billion, which would just as god intended.\n\nNow let's look at the likelihood of both options: 4.5 Billions years = weight of all evidence ever discovered by man. 6000 years = zero evidence and some crackpot fools reading the bible too hard.\n\nIt isn't hard to use Occam to decide which age is correct.
