My Reddit use goes like this:\n\n1. Open reddit.com\n2. Cmd+Click (open in new tab) the stories I want to read\n3. Close reddit.com\n4. For each article, read it, and on the reddit toolbar, up/down vote the article, and click \"Comments\" to read/write comments\n\nSome pages break the reddit toolbar by forcing themselves to the top frame, which breaks step 4. Since I may read the article many hours (or even days for some) after I've opened it, I can't find it on the front page to up/down vote it, or get to the comments. I used to use the \"Reddit this\" bookmarklet to fix this problem, since it would take me to the Comments page.\n\nSo we need at least either:\n\n* re-submission to take us to the original article\n* when opened with a ?url= parameter, to take us to the original article\n* if it doesn't take us to the article and instead insists on giving the \"this has already been submitted\" error, at least make that a link to the pre-existing submission\n\nThis may happen as a side-effect of either of the above, but when we search for the URL itself, it should really take us to the article (at the moment it takes us to the submission page, but I think that searching for the URL itself should take me to the submission regardless) ", "author": "ketralnis", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "id": "c029whx", "subreddit_id": "t5_2h84o", "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": "t3_5yff0", "name": "t1_c029whx", "author_flair_css_class": null}
