The ECMA spec says that eval *always* binds variables in its caller's scope, not the global scope. The WebKit interpretation is that this is regardless of the object the eval method is called on, as the spec is a bit ambiguous (it speaks of a single \"global object\", but web browsers can have multiple \"global objects\" accessible to a script). The Firefox 3 alpha releases now behave the same way.\n\nThe third is fixed in Safari 3 (I don't have Safari 2 installed to play around with it).", "author": "cwzwarich", "created_utc": "1192680430", "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "programming", "ups": 3, "parent_id": "t3_5yjgj", "id": "c029t25", "author_flair_css_class": null}
