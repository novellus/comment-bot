I can go to and of the fast food outlets, including McDonalds, or I can buy a reasonably healthy sandwich, a fruit smoothie and some other (healthy or unhealthy) snack - for LESS than a meal at McDonalds. Poverty doesn't come into this. If I buy a pile of shit and eat it, that is entirely my fault and no one else is to blame. I don't do this, fortunately, and manage to keep a good figure, far from obesity or underweight. Oh yeah, exercise helps too. Not getting exercise is also your fault!
