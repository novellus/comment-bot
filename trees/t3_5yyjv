I suspect that it would be worthwhile to ask the people who have used both the GIMP and Photoshop a few questions:\n\n1. Which did you use first?\n2. How much time did you use each?\n3. How much time did you spend learning each?\n\nI bet the people who have used both and want the GIMP to be like Photoshop have used Photoshop first and more.\n\nI used Photoshop 3 on the Mac once upon a time when I was a thirteen year old pirate (yarrrr), and later on used whatever was current in 2002 or 2003 on the Mac (5 I think). In the interim I used the GIMP 1.x a bunch (I installed Debian when in 1999 and have never looked back). I have to say that going back to Photoshop (for a few projects I had to help people with at school since I was the backroom nerd of all trades) was a bit difficult and I found the UI very unappealing.\n\nThe GIMP has (and even in the 1.x days had) the following killer UI advantages:\n\n1. It was trivial to define new keybindings merely by putting the pointer over the menu item and hitting the key combo to which you wished it be bound.\n2. The menu was available anywhere by right clicking. This is *very* convenient, and one of the things that NeXTSTEP got right and I wish other systems had duplicated.\n3. The GIMP is in fact the Emacs of image editors! You can pop up a repl and start programmatically altering the image; almost all of the functionality is exposed to Scheme through the Procedural Data Base (PDB), and if you know Scheme or Lisp this is a natural way to do weird image synthesis and such.\n4. Continuing down the Emacs of Image Editors road, script-fu is trivial to learn (it was the second dialect of Scheme I picked up after Guile when I was fifteen) and allows you to easily extend the GIMP with new functionality. This is even nicer in the new 2.4 release because you can place your new script commands anywhere in the menu heirarchy whereas before they all lived in the script-fu submenu.\n\nI don't see the GIMP as merely a Free reimplementation of Photoshop: it is a Free implementation of an *image editor*. It is not just for photo retouching, but can be used for general tasks involving images. The scriptability makes it useful for doing myriad things that you wouldn't think to do in Photoshop. As an example, it wouldn't require a very long script to do a task like scanning a book and do basic auto color correction and cropping (another 3 or 4 lines to handle even/odd margins). Imagine a dialog with a filename prefix field, a directory selector to choose where the files go, and a NEXT button that you would hit to capture the next image. This is quite useful!\n\nI also think that comparing Emacs and Word is valid. Emacs is essentially a superset of the functionality of Word. I use it for word processing all the time using the AucTeX mode and the latex preview minor mode (WYSIWYM(ean) is a nice way to do things) which I find much easier to use than say OO.o. Remember that Emacs is an *editor* and not a merely *plain-text editor*.

There may be minor exceptions but I claim this is certainly not true in general.  Meanwhile there are *repeated* pleas for GIMP to be more like Photoshop from people who have used both and decided which they prefer.  See the original poster, for example.\n\nI'm not sure what you're getting at when you mention EMACS vs. Word; maybe you could clarify.  The two have utterly different goals, userbases, and UI designs -- whereas GIMP really does mostly just aspire to be a free re-implementation of Photoshop; just witness its incremental convergence on a Photoshop look and feel.
