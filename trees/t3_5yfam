When I posted about \"Chemtrails\" on my blog, the same day the Department of defense, Boeing, Warren Air force base, a metals supplier and some other interesting IP addresses from Washington showed up there. I removed the post. \r\n\r\nThe fact that they even showed up after I posted about Chemtrails only added to the mystery of Chemtrails. I speculate that Boeing makes the tankers that do the spraying, the airforce does the spraying, the department of defense is behind the spraying and the metals supplier provides the micronized aluminum and barium in the spray. \r\n\r\nJust perhaps this dude was 'taken out' because he threatened to 'let the cat out of the bag' if his monthly pay were not increased. After all just about $14000 a month is a lot of cash for one dude who has an undefined mysterious job definition.\r\n\r\nDo your own homework and post about Chemtrails and watch them flock to your site. I used a 'stat counter' service based in Ireland that shows all traffic and related data, such as location, date and time. Now only 5 'proxy' IP's show up from Washington on a daily basis. I guess they keep tabs on you once you surface with a post relating to their activitys. I only did it once and yet they still keep an eye on me. I find that to be very courious, don't you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "author": "Surfer51", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c029lsn", "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "name": "t1_c029lsn", "parent_id": "t3_5yfam", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}
