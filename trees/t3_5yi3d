Unfortunately, a snowstorm meant changing locations to an uneven road surface and the Areo was limited to 221 mph before its driver had to back off. Only using half throttle at that speed, the Aero's available 1183 bhp was massive and could spin the wheels at 190 in 6th gear! SSC's photographer reports that that they will try again for the production speed record at a better location in the near future. \r\n\r\nOctober 31st 2006, Las Vegas - Using SCC's proprietary twin-turbo design, the Ultimate Aero TT's power plant has surpassed its original design specifications in all areas, producing a nasty 1180 bhp at 6750 rpm and 961 ft lbs of tarmac tearing torque while maintaining a paltry 2750 lbs of curb weight. The meticulously manufactured carbon fibre composite body harnesses a motor that has a wonderful idle, incredible daily drivability characteristics, runs on 91 octane pump fuel, easily handles the rigors of long term redline usage while delivering and incredible 15 mpg in the city and 22 mpg on the highway. \r\n\r\nFurther establishing its place among the supercars, the Ultimate Aero TT produces more emissions legal horsepower than any other production automobile in the world, thanks in the large part to the tireless efforts of the design team. \r\n\r\nBut the dedication to every small detail doesn't stop at excellent performance; the hand-stitched, custom leather interior will turn heads all by itself. Race-ready seats are designed to accommodate a driver up to 6'7'' and 300 lbs. Standard features include power windows, power locks, security system, DVD player, a backup camera, height adjustment, premium sounds system, five-light sequential shift indicator and a horsepower gauge. \r\n\r\nSSC plans a limited run of only 25 cars with a distinctive number plate matching chassis numbers to protect its collector value. \r\n\r\nStory by SSC, edited by Supercars.net \r\n ", "author": "jeffglucker", "created_utc": "1192632390", "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_c029nwz", "id": "c029nx7", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 2, "name": "t1_c029nwz", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5yi3d", "retrieved_on": 1427426220, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c029nwz", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5yi3d", "body": "Better description found elsewhere:\r\n\r\nShelby Supercars (SSC), manufacturer of the ultra high-performance Ultimate Aero Twin Turbo, set the new 'World's Fastest Production Car' record earlier today with an average top speed of 255.83 mph. Confident of the 1183 hp vehicle's abilities, SSC set out to validate their top speed claim in accordance with the strict guidelines set by Guinness World Records. Among other requirements, in order to meet Guinness\u00e2\u0080\u0099 approval, a vehicle testing for the top speed record must drive down the course, turn around, and make a second pass in the opposite direction within one hour. The vehicle's official top speed is calculated by averaging the top speeds of each pass in order to negate any favorable road or weather conditions. Today, on a temporarily-closed two lane stretch of public highway in Washington State, the Ultimate Aero posted a top speed of 257.11 mph (413.83 kph) on its first pass and 254.55 mph (409.71 kph) on its return pass, yielding a new top speed record: a staggering 255.83 mph (411.76 kph). The data, collected by Dewetron's world-renowned GPS tracking system, will be verified by Guinness before the Ultimate Aero is officially crowned the ''World's Fastest Production Car.'' This breaks the current official record held by the Koenigsegg CCR at 242 mph by 13.83 mph and the Bugatti Veyron's unofficial speed of 253 mph by 3.11 mph.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
