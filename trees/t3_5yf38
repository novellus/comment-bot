The end effect is rural hospitals do not make enough money in order to keep their doors open.  It's kind of hard to keep your doors open when you're only getting a few patients a week yet still need to be stocked up on medical supplies.  So, the rest of the country ends up subsidizing the rural parts of the country at greater amount than the urban areas through medicare financing to those rural hospitals and communities.  Back in 1997, under the Balanced Budget Act, these medicare financing payouts were cut forcing medical closures in rural areas to the point where the rural medicare financing payouts had to be re-increased under the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999.

You can look at individual countries in Europe, some are more pronounced.  Now think about the consequences of that.  Germany, in the Factbook, for example, currently has 8.2 births for every 10.71 deaths, and when factoring in immigration has a population growth of -.033%.  They are having 1.4 births/woman... and the replacement rate is 2.1 births/woman.  Other European countries are worse off.  Think about pensions and health care.  As the work force ages, more people are retired and needing care (even though people work longer now, except Europe has much stricter laws in that regard than we do), and yet there are *fewer* workers to provide the income, and therefore tax revenue, to support those pension funds.  This gets worse and worse as the births decline and there are more and more longer living retirees.\n\nI'll let that sink in for a bit, but there's your *facts.*\n\nSo I'll ask again:\n\n1) Europe is crumbling under the weight of its welfare obligations.

The government confiscating our money to pay for others' care that they don't necessarily want is a waste in my opinion.\n\nWhat is wrong with taking away the government restrictions on care?  Why does Average Joe American need sex-change surgery in his plan if he isn't going to ever need it?  Hell, why does he *need* care at all if he doesn't want to pay for it and he's young and spry?  Isn't that his decision?  Why does the government have a right (point that out in the Constitution firstly) to tell us we *must* have health insurance and then confiscate our money to pay for it when we don't even want it?\n\nI understand and appreciate the compassion of the need for a minimum level of care.  I want everyone that needs health insurance to have it as well.  I firmly believe that people need to make their own choices, though, and that competition breeds innovation and lower costs with higher quality.  We have a system that is somewhere in the middle now and we need to commit one way or the other.\n\nI understand a \"free market\" system as is has never been tried and I understand those fears.  But I see an aging European population overburdened with welfare, social security, and health benefits as their birth rates fall.  They cannot sustain their obligations in the long term.\n\nAs Alexis d'Toqueville warned, once a democracy learns it can vote itself money, it will self destruct.

There may be wait times (though I find most reports to be a bit exagerated. Wait times for emergency and critical stuff is usually as low or lower, non-emergency stuff perhaps not), but you are covered no matter what and the costs are lower, paid through taxes.\n\nI would not do away with private insurance totally. The idea of the socialized system is to provide a basic level of care for all people. To me, that means lots of preventative medicine, basic stuff, etc...

Its called innovation to reapply things from one area to another, and health badly needs innovation.\n\nI also continue to contest that socialist systems do \"better\" than us.  Ours costs a lot more currently for individuals, unless you factor in the ludicrous tax rates of these Western socialist systems.  They have absolutely unacceptable wait times for treatments in these socialist systems as well, which causes their rich to come here, and it stems from price controls.  They also have waste in the form of people going to the doctor for anything and everything because they are spending other peoples' money.  This is why the government is wasteful (they spend our money), and why socialist health is wasteful (they spend our money).\n\nRemember the price freeze on gas under President Carter?  It caused lines, long lines, and shortages.  Imagine that in health care and you begin to understand the problems associated with Britain and Canada's lines now.  Then, when you understand what scale does to those systems, we realize that a socialized system is going to break down even further when its scaled up from Britain's population to America's population.\n\nThere are better ways to do things than the wait times and the government waste.  The socialized systems look great on paper, to some people, because the government's have *warped* what the free market can do with regulations here in the United States.

A partnership between federal and state governments (like medicare) where federal money is given to states to pass out as they please. More info at the wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Children's_Health_Insurance_Program\n\n\nThe Democratic Stance:\n\nThe money goes overwhelmingly to help low income families insure their children. This is a good program. They have asked for more money to expand it.\n\n\nThe Republican Stance:\n\nBecause the states can do what they want with the money, money goes to insuring families that live well over the poverty line, older children (up to age 26), etc... This is a step towards socialized medicine. It takes people out of private insurance and puts them on government rolls.\n\n\nMy rebuttle:\n\na) The States do what the want with the money. Why are Republicans suddenly trying to tell the states what to do?\n\nb) The money overwhelmingly goes to needy children. There are some abberations, but I've yet to see stats that say even more than 10% of the money goes to those who aren't worthy.\n\nc) Insurance premiums differ by state and by individual dramatically. In states like New Jersey (which has been a battleground on this issue), the cost of living is high. Couple that with children with preexisting conditions (they are sick and will need a lot of treatment, and as such are bad business for insurers, who then charge higher premiums), it is certainly believable that a family making as much as $60k a year wouldn't be able to afford health insurance. It shouldn't be that way, but the US system is so fucked that it is.\n\nSo...how was that for an overview?", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c029iko", "id": "c029ior", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1427426286, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "created_utc": "1192560443", "ups": 2, "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5yf38", "downs": 0, "score": 2, "id": "c029ixd", "author": "bluGill", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "body": "Several reasons:  First, this is not the responsibility of the federal government.

That really bothers me as a talking point because that's simply not a possibility in the US.  a) The hospitals would never stand for it.  b) The physicians would never stand for it.  c) The lobbyists for the health care industry are far far too powerful for that to ever happen.  It is the beginning of a universal health care coverage system which isn't a bad thing at all.  If anything, it will stem the 16% GDP expenditure the US pays in health care, 53% of which is expenditures on private insurance and private spending.  You want to pay less for the same quality of health care?  Make it a single payer, government administered health insurance system.  The physicians remain the same, the hospitals remain the same, the service remains the same.  Risk pooling over the entire population greatly lowers health care costs and increases negotiating power for services and prescription drugs (drugs accounting for 11-16% of our health care expenditure).  If you're so worried about cost, then look at the cost of private insurance that you're paying out of pocket.  The insurance premium for the average family of 4 in the US is $11,500, usually split 60/40 between employer/employee.  There's no saying that insurance you pay for will actually be of any use seeing as insurance companies can deny you at the drop of a hat, and I've seen more than my fair share of this over the years.  Single payer allows for a 17% reduction in administration and billing (34% currently in the US, 17% in Canada...you'd call this the \"bureaucratic overhead\" if you referred to it in a governmental system versus a private system).  Reduction in that overhead alone would lead to substantial savings.  You'd probably get the average family of four health care down into the range of a couple grand a year.  Essentially, you wouldn't have to worry about, \"Oh me!  Oh my!

Universal health care coverage is a mechanism of financing health care through insurance coverage of some sort, whether it be single payer (as in Canada) or through private insurance, multi-payer systems.  This is financing health care costs.  However, the medical practice, the mechanism of delivering health care, remains private (or public as in the case of institutions which are already public such as state university hospitals or state operated free health care clinics).  By and large, the systems are private and increasingly for-profit in the US.  In Canada, however, the majority of the clinics and hospitals are public.  That does not mean opening a private practice is illegal, though, as long as you accept the universal health care insurance.  The doctor isn't employed by the government, his/her staff isn't employed by the government, and the administration of the practice isn't owned or controlled by the government.  What is illegal in *some* universal health care coverage systems is private insurance that offers redundant coverage, i.e. coverage that you would get under universal coverage offerings.  In Canada, the ruling was that it is illegal for a private clinic to accept a fee for services that would normally be covered under their single payer system, not \"You can't setup shop here...\"  \n\nSocialized medicine, on the other hand, is a mechanism of health care delivery where the practicing physician works for and is directly employed by the state health care services.  In other words, the government actually runs the hospitals, employs the physicians, and handles hospital administration.  The UK has socialized medicine although even they have expanded into the private sector through private finance initiatives...which has also caused their system to undergo a period of debt.  Quite a bad choice on the account of the Conservatives in power in 1992 in the UK, and an even worse decision for the Labour party to continue the money draining practice.  I digress, however.  The point is that in socialized medicine, the delivery of the health care services is done directly by the government employees; in this case, the physicians, nurses, surgeons, etc.\n\nSo, no, to correct your assertions, private practices most certainly are not illegal under the Canadian single payer system, only private insurance.

So a doctor has to waste his time doing the job of a nurse practitioner, and someone who really needs him can't get care.\n\nAgain, you are confusing medical regulation with medical insurance. Lots of countries with public medical insurance do make these adjustments. Indeed, for a variety of reasons it is easier to implement these kinds of procedures in such an environment.\n\n&gt; It's not like the government redistributed a limited supply of vaccine/knowledge of hygene. They simply produced more. I don't think thats possible for the current situation.\n\nSigh. Let's take malaria as an example. They figured out it was cheaper and easier to wipe malaria out entirely than to treat all the people who got sick from it.\n\nYour missing the point as to *why* more was produced. If you are responsible for everyone, it is cheaper to, for example, raise sanitary conditions for everyone. If you raise sanitary conditions simply for the folks who are enrolled with a particular HMO, it doesn't really help that much to reduce even their medical needs, because they still get exposed to disease from the rest of the unsanitary population.\n\nYou aren't going to see HMO's footing the bill for improved sanitation systems, garbage disposal, or anything else unless they band together through some kind of collective interest that covers the vast majority of the population, and at that point said entity will be virtually indistinguishable from government anyway.\n\n&gt; The public health campaigns weren't redistributing anything. They were mostly just spreading knowledge/vaccines. Both knowledge and vaccines are easy to make more of. Medical services are harder.\n\nHey, now you are starting to get it. It is cheaper and easier to do certain things, but there isn't a profit incentive for a private health insurance company that represents only a small percentage of the population.\n\n&gt; Thanks to medical licensing laws, the \"helpdesk\" type medical jobs (giving antibiotics/basic medical advice) are only done by MDs. That's as dumb as requiring a Ph.D. before you can clean spyware off people's computers.\n\nThose types of licensing restrictions exist in countries with both private and public health insurance, and they often exist for good reasons. When an MCSE fucks up, people usually don't die.\n\n&gt; This is a problem caused (partially) by the government. I don't see how getting them to take money from me and give it to the MD's/beaurocrats will fix this.\n\nBecause, unlike the MCSE, the non-specialist needs almost as much training as the specialist. Furthermore, the non-specialists actually provide the bulk of the \"value\" in terms of health care (as you correctly point out, the vast majority of the time you don't need a specialist for your health care needs). By creating a shortage of the non-specialists you actually *increase* the need for specialists, which in turn increases your overall medical costs. It works in a private health care system because it increases the incidence of the most severe moral hazards in the whole economics of medicine, so you can justify the higher cost and you even get higher patient satisfaction rates.

I have lived under both public and private insurance systems and have a very practical understanding of their application.\n\nIn practice, public insurance systems say NO to people all the time. Interestingly, because people are indirectly paying for their insurance there is actually less of a sense of entitlement on the part of individuals and MUCH less so on the part of the larger public. You see this in the statistics for the kinds of treatments (particularly the expensive ones) that are provided on a per-capita basis in the US vs. other industrialized nations.\n\nFurthermore, in practice, insurance companies often say NO to a treatment that will prevent more substantial costs at a later date. Even worse, they aren't even asked if someone is uninsured. However, once a situation is life-or-death, insurance companies are required to cover them. Even worse, even if the insurance companies aren't required, frequently hospitals/doctors are required to treat them, which then leads to the whole bankruptcy cycle. That means the costs do get absorbed by those of us with insurance. So even when you are naively thinking that you aren't having to pay for the medical care of all those people who can't afford it, you are, in a manner that is far more expensive than public health insurance (not to mention the negative consequences for your own health that stem from this).\n\nThe one area where the US health care system tends to beat the rest of the world is patient satisfaction. A large part of the reason for this is that the system is far less likely to tell a patient \"NO\". Why? There are a lot of reasons, not the least of which are lawsuits (which work a lot better when life-or-death decisions can be attributed to a profit motive rather than merely triage).\n\n&gt; Bureaucrats would rather spend the money than tell people that some people need to die because it isn't cost effective to keep them around and risk to get sued or lose their jobs.\n\nThere seems to be this weird notion that bureaucratic type folks only exist in government.

The additional monies can be used for a lot of different purposes. Traditionally they were used to pay out dividends, but high growth companies often use them to buy back shares, acquire other companies, hedging, or they put it in to short term investments to provide stability. Either way, it is still very much profit, and I can assure you, \"hey, we have this extra money, why don't we lower prices?\"  doesn't cross anyone's minds.at your typical business.\n\n&gt; My guess as to why Walmart's profit margin is low is because they are not expanding, so investors won't make as much on any stock they buy today. Walmart's productivity has mostly leveled out.\n\nNo. Walmart's margin has been like this pretty much since its inception. [Wikipedia reports](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart) that in 2006 it was ranked 67th out of the top 100 retailers in terms of profit margin (which should at least clarify for you that even in retail a lot of companies, despite growing slower than Walmart in many cases, have a higher profit margin). Walmart's revenue grew by 8.7% from the previous year for the 35-week period ending Oct 5, 2007. [Hoover's lists their growth rate at 10.5%](http://www.hoovers.com/wal-mart/--ID__11600--/free-co-factsheet.xhtml).  If you look at their financial reports you'll see a pretty steady ~10% growth rate each year. Sure, Google has a higher one, but it is pretty similar to Microsoft's growth rate, despite Microsoft having roughly nine times the margin.\n\nWalmart has been opening over 300 stores *in the US* (most of their recent expansion has been overseas) a year for the last few years. They have over 3,000 stores in the US right now, and lately they've been mostly opening the bigger stores more than the smaller ones. They also have been opening more stores than they did the year before as far back as I can see. Sure, it's hard for them to grow at 2x given their huge size, but they are still investing and growing at a prodigious rate.\n\n&gt; My guess as to why Walmart's profit margin is low is because they are not expanding, so investors won't make as much on any stock they buy today.\n\nProfit margin doesn't care about investors (of course the other way around is another matter ;-). Whether investors decide to pay more for your company's stock or not doesn't effect your profit margin (well, there is the impact from ESOP's, but I'm guessing you weren't referring to this).\n\n&gt; I'm not saying that a large company is just as fragile as a small company. I'm saying that they are both vulnerable if they don't offer what people want and someone else does.\n\nYes, but your assertion that this means products and services will be sold for what is effectively cost is only rational if you are dealing with a true commodity product (and even then really is only true for a hyper competitive marketplace).

It's just that companies like Wallmart have so many stores that 1%-3% ends up being a lot more money.\n\nI'm sorry, but you don't know what you are talking about. First of all, people tend to talk about profit margin, which is (net income/net sales revenue). Since \"net income\" = \"net sales revenue - expenses\", profit margins will always be a smaller ratio than you are quoting. Despite this, you'll find that profit margins are well above 3% for publicly traded businesses. Small business often do worse, but small businesses often *lose money* and go out of business, so that's not really that surprising. I used to be part of a small business association, and most of the members considered it a good year if they had a greater than 10% margins and a great year if they had greater than 20% margins. 3% margins would definitely be considered a bad year or a \"building\" year.\n\nThink of it this way: lots of successful small business have only a few million in revenue. If your margin is &lt;3%, that means your typical successful small business owner is making &lt;$30k/year... probably less than a lot of their employees. Sorry, I don't buy it. I've seen too many Ivy League college educations paid for this way.\n\nTake a look at publicly traded stocks. Thanks to the SEC we can a complete tabulation of their revenue and profits. You will find that profits are often significantly more than 3% margins.
