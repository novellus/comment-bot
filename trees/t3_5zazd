No underage drinking, no this, no that.\n\nOnce the kid is free from those restrictions, they become someone else.

Sure, you give them responsibilities, but you don't let them make *all* the decisions cuz they're not capable at that age of making completely rational decisions.    \n\nYou build a relationship with your kids by giving them choices: you can wear this or this, but not that, and if I catch you with that, you're grounded.  You build a relationship by talking to your kids about WHY you make certain decisions.  It's not only about nothing bad happening *to* them; it's about how they see themselves in society, are they leaders or followers?  What are they following &amp; why?  What will people think of you?  What do you want people to think of you?    \n\nBeing left out &amp; feeling different from your friends is in NO WAY the worst lesson to learn as a child.  I don't plan on buying my kids anything with a name-brand on it, my parents couldn't ever afford that crap &amp; I know I'm better for not feeling the need to keep up with the Joneses.  I am my own woman.    \n\nI don't think anyone under 16 should be making ANY sexual decisions period.  (I didn't have sex till college, and I hope to raise a child that respects themselves that much as well... I put myself in some questionable situations before that, but am glad I didn't give in.)  Honestly: I don't want anyone having sex in my house but my husband and myself, so if the kid's old enough to have their own money to get a hotel room, or their own apartment, I can't stop them.  That's the line I'll draw.    \n\nThe goal isn't repressing sexual desires here, the goal is respecting one's body &amp; one's future.  I might respect love if I saw it, but a long-term &amp; loving relationship is the only situation in which I'd want my child considering sex an option.    \n\nI don't plan on controlling my kids forever: I plan on preparing them to be adults when they're 18 &amp; giving them decisions to make &amp; teaching them about the world.  But that also means explaining to them that when it's on my tab: I make the decisions.

But once he or she has a desire to dress some way, there is no point in controlling them or trying to *force* them into some other generation.\n\nParents were saying that women were sluts in Victorian times for showing their ankles in public.  Now we have bikinis.  People said that Swing music and marijuana made people crazy and made white women have sex with black men.  People said Rap music and Rock corrupt the mind.\n\nI think in all cases, once you kid has expressed their desire, especially *sexual* desire (dressing sexually), you aren't helping them out to impose an authoritarian regime on them.  It's your job to talk to them and *persuade* them to make the decisions you want.  **There is no lesson learned by forcing a person to do something they don't want to do**.\n\nIt's completely closed-minded to think you know it will 'damage' them to wear that clothing in public when the reality is you don't have a clue.  People have been saying that modern scandalous dress will turn women into sluts for hundreds of years.  Culture changes.  Get over it.\n\nHow are you expecting to build a future relationship with your kids, when you tell them you don't trust their decision making abilities in the area of their generation's culture, especially given how different one tends to be from the other?  Have you ever considered that maybe they will dress how they want to dress and nothing bad will happen?\n\nHow are you expecting to build a trusting relationship for **serious** future sexual conversations?  \n\nWhen you search their closet you're telling them that you don't respect their individuality and their right to make sexual decisions for themselves.  You're telling them you think there is something **wrong** with their sexual desires.  You're telling them they don't have the right to be sexual.  **That is the worse goddamn thing you could ever teach your daughter**.\n\nYour job is to teacher your daughter how to be the person she is, safely, informed.  It is **not** to decide who she is.  Your daughter might be a girl that likes tube tops.  Is that wrong?  How old does she have to get before your arbitrarily decide it's okay?\n\nIf your son or daughter is starting to have sexual desires, the worst fucking thing in the world you can do is alienate them over stupid issues like a tube top.  It's just putting up a barrier to talking about things that really matter later on.  When they see everyone else wearing a tube top, and they see that it doesn't make a goddamn difference, they will stop respecting **you**.\n\nI am sorry that you think it's \"wrong\" for your child to be feeling sexual desires.  Too fucking bad for you.  There is nothing wrong about their desires.  If they have homosexual desires, there is nothing wrong with that either.  **Sexuality is a core part of an adult's identity**.  If you try to *repress it* you are doing no one a favor.\n\nIf you think you have to protect your daughter because she *has* no self-respect, and will immediately give it up to some boy just because she's wearing a tube top, then you are *already* to blame, and no dressing police authoritarian regime will change things.\n\nLet me give you a tip -- and this is a tip also used by professional coaches to motivate their players.  If you *really* want someone to do something, or not do something, you must get them to respect you.  You must get them to value your opinion almost more than their own.  You must communicate to them that you will be let down if they don't do what you want.\n\nYou **cannot** control your kid forever.  Forcing them to do things is at best a temporary solution and will not teach them anything.\n\nYou should understand that the real damage of wearing a tube top is almost certainly less than the feeling you create in her of being left out and different from her friends.  Of having parents who do stupid things she doesn't understand, and can't communicate with her well enough to convince her do something simple of her own free will. \n\nThink of the long run.  If your daughter perceives that you have a negative opinion of her sexuality, think it's *wrong*, that she \"shouldn't be doing those things\" ... is she going to come to you later to talk about sex, or ask for condoms?  No, she isn't, because you don't respect her opinions.
