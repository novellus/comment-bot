Don't just invest pre-tax, do it smart and in this order: 401K to employer match.  HSA to maximum, if applicable.  Roth IRA.  401K non-matched.  529 if you still need to sock away more.  Try to get to 20% instead of 15%.\n\n5.  This should be done in a 529 and happen in tandem with 4, otherwise it may not happen in time.\n\n6. Don't do this unless you are getting screwed on interest.  This is the cheapest loan money you will ever get your hands on.  That money to pay down your mortgage is better spent topping off you 401K or a 529 for retirement.\n\n7. Invest in real estate only if it suits you.  Mutual funds are a fire and forget option.  Real estate is work.  The additional return from real estate is not so substantial that the headaches and risks can be ignored.\n\nI'd add a 1.5: Start paying everything with rewards credit cards.
