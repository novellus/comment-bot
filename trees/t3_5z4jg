Today we had a lengthy interview, with a blind Indian engineer working at Google on exactly that problem. He explained that the accessibility-enhanced search will as first priority select the best/most relevant pages by google\u2019s standard closely-guarded-secret algorithms, but then order those results to ensure that the highest-placed results are accessible.\n\n&gt; He even gave some technical details of how the accessibility assessment works. The perennial subject of alt attributes was mentioned (without details on how they assess them), but more interestingly, he referred to well-structured pages, and clearly uses HTML heading markup as a criterion.\n\n&gt; It\u2019s all happening very quietly, but it\u2019s gratifying to those of us who have been banging on about this for years.\n\n", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2fwo", "name": "t1_c02bc0c", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "ups": 2, "link_id": "t3_5z4jg", "retrieved_on": 1427425370, "body": " To paraphrase Felten: Given a choice between dancing pigs and Web standards, users will take the pigs every time.\n\nOn that note, ObQwe1234:\n\n&gt; googlebot parses it, that means it 'validates' for any useful meaning of the word. i've been developing high-performance web sites back when you were making jokes about 'mouse balls' with your little schoolyard friends. one thing i do understand (that lazy idiot whiners don't seem to) is that if your page loads in more than 200ms it's completely unusable. so given a choice between a 200ms load time and complying with some horseshit bureaucratic 'standard' of course i'm going to take usability every time.
