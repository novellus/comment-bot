Once activated, the herpes zoster virus travels along the path of a nerve to the skin's surface, where it causes shingles.[2] [3]\n\nThat's pretty much what happened to him - he had an accident and lost a lot of blood, got weakened, then the shingles hit him.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02buwp", "id": "c02bx5k", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "name": "t1_c02buwp", "ups": 1, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5zadr", "retrieved_on": 1427425125, "score_hidden": false, "body": "Just so you know, chickenpox at a later age can be even more harmful, have more complications and take longer to get over (with more severe symptoms).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt;The severity of the disease tends to be worse with age; adults are sicker and more uncomfortable than children, and it tends to take longer for adults to recover.

Who are our kids going to play with, when all the other parents are all overprotective? \r\nPlus, our living areas are not set up for somebody who does not drive to get around. \r\n\r\nTheres a wonderful set of parks by my house, but to walk to it, you need to cross a 45 mph highway with a sharp curve close to where you'd cross, and shit, I don't even like thinking about doing that on foot, much less a little kid with short legs and no height to see.  \r\n\r\nEdit: There's a nice river and another park across another 45 mph street. I don't know who the fuck thought 45 was a good idea for a short residential street with nothing but houses and playgrounds and parks.", "author_flair_css_class": null}

We are living not in a 'risk-averse society' but we are living in a 'culture of blame'. The huge popularity of extreme sports is testament to the fact that we are not risk-averse. But we live in a culture of blame: should anything go wrong someone must be punished. Most people do not understand that many events are rather out of anyone's control. When it comes to children this tendency to blame is further exacerbated, and the blame is most often put on the parents. If a child suffers any kind of accident the parent is held responsible almost by default. \n\nI am a new parent who is trying not to overprotect his new daughter but I have to say social pressures are huge. Any attempt to allow my toddler to be independent and to make mistakes is met with shock and tsk-tsk-tsk's by my relatives. I am lucky that she is so far growing beautifully, but should anything at all go wrong (i.e. any kind of accident or illness however minor) I already know I will be severely blamed.
