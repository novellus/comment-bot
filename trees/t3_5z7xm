Because the majority of Reddit users are from the US.\n\nSo posting this submission at 11PM EST on a Friday night is not going to get you a large or representative fraction of the population to get any meaningful answers about reddit aggregate behavior.\n\n&gt;Over the last few months...\n\nYour account is barely a month old.\n\n&gt;...Reddit has increasingly declined into stories which generally fit the following categories\n\nSo you have no data here. If you really have been observing Reddit. *Get off you ass and take some notes*. If you have coding skills scrape the pages and build a database and then present the data to the community. At least half a dozen people have already done this at various times. If you don't have coding skills, save the stories you hate with the save button and then copy those links into your next series of complaints. At least you'll have some position to argue from.\n\nBut let's go beyond the Reddit community examining itself. More recently Pew Media Research did a study of the 3 big social bookmarking sites and found reddit  had the most serious news and the highest correspondence to mainstream serious news. Which means Reddit as flawed as it is is the best of breed service at the moment.\n\n&gt;why you're promoting these stories. They are not news...Believe it or not the little upvote button you press on each of these stories doesn't make a damn difference\n\nBut yet they are and they do. The general outlines are known, but the details are not. \n\nTake for example the main Reddit political story of this week as just a single example.\n\nThe capitulation of the Democratic Senate on telecom immunity for the FISA violations. This was coupled with instant action demands of phone calls to Senators, and reflected similar campaigns happening all across the left blogsphere. $150,000 dollars was raised through this non-centrally coordinated effort which included Reddit for the Presidential Candidate of Chris Dodd, who put a hold on the Bill, and then was confident enough to filibuster after it was identified that the Democratic Senate Majority leader was going to violate parliamentary procedure and ignore the hold.\n\nFurther the ACLU got into the act help people notify their own Senators, while other groups    forced most of the rest of the Dem candidates to support the blockage of telecom immunity. Developments on this story are forth coming constantly because this is real world legislation and it matters.\n\nWas any of this covered on TV, newspaper, talk radio? Barely if at all. Certainly not in realtime as was done by reddit.\n\nReddit is a great early warning system, and is evolving slowly into a group consensus people mover. If news scores attention on reddit it matters. Take for example the FEMA scam press conference that was today's top political story. The Washington Post buried it on A19, 3 people on reddit picked up on it at around the same time as the left blogsphere, and by the end of the day the White House backed down. It's the second political story including the Dodd/FISA legislation hold, this week where reddit's finger was right on the pulse of the news, and the story itself was so hot that underlying issue was confronted entirely by the attention drawn to it and pressures that attention brought down.\n\nIs there still a signal to noise ratio? Sure. I personally, could do without the pictures, though I have to say they are some pretty interesting pictures. Reddit is the current best of breed and it's working.\n\nSome previous complaints have been about things reddit was very early on. For example the Cheney-neocon let's get Iran PR campaign. In August when the first signs indicated it was coming, Reddit took a lot of flack from some very vocal curmudgeons. Now that this is a mainstream worry as the PR campaign is in full swing we can see how right Reddit was and how wrong the carmudgeons were. Or take the sub prime melt down, that Reddit picked up at the end of July, as it was happening. It wasn't until after the Fed unexpectedly dropped a half point in September that the mainstream even began to acknowledge there was officially a problem.\n\nThis is some amazing stuff. Revolutionary.\n\n&gt;it just makes the frontpage of Reddit look more and more rediculous politicized each day\n\nTo someone used to news sources that don't report news, I guess seeing real news happen right in front of them with calls for participation can be a bit disturbing. So my advice to you is to actually start participating rather than complaining.\n\nStart submitting the things you like to reddit. You will help foster a micro-community that will provide you with similarly themed stuff that you wouldn't have been able to read otherwise. Use the friends.reddit.com and the prefs to filter categories of news you don't want to know about.\n\nAnd don't make assumptions that you can't back up with facts. \n\n&gt;sensationalist, anti-corporation, anti-US, biased views and funny\n\nIf you look at my profile you will see that my \"sensationalist anti-corporate anti-US sources\" are largely the Washington Post, the New York Times, and pretty mainstream blogsphere that maps very similarly to well known \"anti-American\" two time editor of the *The New Republic* Rick Hertzberg.\n\n&gt;\"Where do you go every day on the Web?\n\n&gt;I go to Talking Points Memo several times a day\u2014the main site and its offshoots. That's the set of sites I go to by far the most. TPM feels like home; ideologically and politically it's a perfect fit for me. I can rely on it to draw my attention to anything that's of major interest to me in the world of public affairs. I go to two of the Atlantic blogs, namely Sullivan and Yglesias. Slightly less often I go to Romenesko and Crooks &amp; Liars and Wolcott and Fallows; and Kevin Drum at the Washington Monthly. The American Prospect I go to almost daily. The Plank, the New Republic's group blog. Steve Clemons' Washington Note. Glenn Greenwald is someone I go to a lot. I check out Kos now and then to take the temperature of the teeming liberal masses.\" \n\nsource [well known \"anti-American\" Radar magazine](http://radaronline.com/features/2007/10/hendrik_hertzberg_the_new_yorker_charles_kaiser_1.php)\n\nAs for the pictures. That's not my area. And I would see them relegated somewhere else. But Alas even the illustrious New Yorker has comics, so I guess they are probably here to stay.

Spez has a nasty war going with some bot accounts. Word to the wise: don't cross him with usage abuse cause he's ruthless, not that that's your problem.\n\nWhen talking about a specific story you should provide a link to the submission.\n\nLooking at your profile, it looks like you don't really have a consistent theme in your submissions. It's all sort of humorish soft news stuff. So that's a very hard micro-community to nurture, because it's all over the net. There's no aching need for that kind of news. People who succeed gaining karma on those kind of topics tend to poach them from other systems where they are already proven to be popular, which is I'm guessing where your finding these things to submit.\n\nThe best strategy and usually the most useful one to the average redditor, is to post about what you really like. If you are into gardening, then post the really cool stuff about gardening. You will attract other gardeners and they will share stuff they read that you haven't seen back to you. Before you know it you'll have a micro-community, that you actually enjoy reading and participating in. \n\nThe crap shoot approach to submissions doesn't really work on Reddit.
