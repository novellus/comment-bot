Where does the writer of this piece get off making such a statement. Let me declare right here and now that I own not one iota of Bush's war. Those fools felt no moral dilema in entering Iraq in the first place, and it's no fault of mine that their magic Jesus hasn't intervened on behalf of the oil barons and Neo-Con snake handlers. How to get out? Try saying, \"sorry, we've learned our lesson and will leave you folks be from now on.\" Simplistic? Of course. It's also the only plan that doesn't require more death and destruction. Those who started the war own it, even though my grandchildren will be still paying for it. This Mother Jones article would have us all play the role of the \"good German\". We who have no blood on our hands, who protested against this idiocy from the start, will not stand by and accept this angst as ours. When it's all over, far into the future, I want to be able to truthfully declare, \"I never went along with Fascism. In fact, I actively worked against it.\" And you know what? History will prove we discontent masses right, as it always does.
