ANSI C is easy enough to write, so if you're writing a small bit of code to do something simple, like copy a few files (e.g. a program patcher), why embed a Java/Ruby Virtual Machine for a 2MB exe when you could instead have a tiny 2KB exe that won't take 100MB of RAM to open!\n\nChoose your language to develop something not on preference, but on project requirements. 2KB download for a simple program is much better than a 2MB download that will take a few minutes setting up the virtual machine...\n\nBut if you're writing a game, make things easy and choose a rapid development language instead of assembly...
