Furthermore, he trusts his superiors completely, whether because of fervor towards *The Cause* or brainwashing by and within *The Cause*, or some combination of all three.\n\n\nAlready, a few in a wide spectrum of images \nhave arisen in the imagination.  Near one side, but not necessarily the endpoint,  are preteen and teenage girls told to pierce their ears to support _The Cause of beauty_, or of _their beauty_.  Toward the other side, but still not necessarily the extreme,  are suicide cults, suicide bombers, and genocidal generals.  At points tbd in between those places on the spectrum, you might find people who had tattoos, persistent dieters, anorexic, bulimic people, on through domestic abusers, burglars, grave robbers, etc.  \n\n*This Follower's* place on the spectrum is not yet defined, but which factors determine where he lay?\n\nThe Objective Justice of The Cause?\nThe Objective Truth of The Cause?\nThe Subjective justice and truth of The cause?\nWhich others?\n\n\nFor clarity, let me say that objective truth is something certainly true.  2+2=4 true.  \n\nSubjective truth is something perceived to be true, but is not necessarily true.  A general perception that 2+2=3 is subjectively true if the consensus of all concerned agree that it is so.  2+2=4 is subjectively true if everyone accepts it as fact, but can neither explain it nor prove its underlying principles.  \"We are the greatest nation\" is subjectively true\"  etc.\n\nIs justice always subjective or can it be  objective?\n\nSaid person (\"This Follower\") is told to never outright lie about it, but always to _defer_ rather than telling the truth.\n\nInstead of saying \"God placed these marks on me,\" for instance, This Follower  waits (as directed) until someone is rash enough to *Question This Follower's injury*, and waits still further until a bolder Defender Of The Cause, which may not be his superior, but just another pious individual, speaks up to demand of the Questioner, whether he believes in The Cause, and whether the Questioner believes that The Cause is capable of causing the Injury, and waiting for the Questioner to \nfeel intimidated into asserting belief.\n\nIs The Follower guilty?\n\n", "author_flair_css_class": null}
