There's no way the huge massive ball of fire which is the source of all life in our solar system could possibly effect our planet. The fact that there's \"global warming\" on other planets in our solar system is clearly just coincidence. And of course the fact that the climate has constantly gone through warming and cooling phases for all of history, causing the extinction of millions of species as well as the growth of new ones, is irrelevent because CLEARLY now that we're here on earth everything will stay the same forever just to suit us unless of course we change it because we're that all powerful. \n\nAs for the technology thing: my point is the climate WILL change regardless of what we do. There WILL be global warming and there WILL be ice ages, it's ALWAYS happened. Technology has already helped us adapt to these changes. \n\nAll I'm saying is I haven't seen a viable solution to climate change yet. When we find something we can do about it I'll be all for it, but as of now wasting trillions of dollars to MAYBE effect temperatures at a MUCH lower level than we can even accurately detect just doesn't do it for me.

On the other hand in poorer nations where they would be denied the cheap energy which allowed our nation to grow we'd get even more deaths than there already are. And then in the end our efforts would prove to be completely futile as the climate is dynamic and the universe once again proves what insignificant little specs we are; seeing how carbon dioxide makes up like .003% of the atmosphere and our emissions make up next to 0% of that number. \n\nHe forgot the third possible column where technology allows us to effect climate change way more than any other possible proposed action I've ever heard. In this case either the alarmists are right and we save ourselves, or they are wrong and the world goes once again into an ice age which we also save ourselves from. \n\nUntil I hear a possible solution which actually MIGHT help... I'm going to stick with hoping we're lucky instead of making our lives suck for absolutely no benefit.\n\nThe cover up of the complete failure of kyoto is pretty amazing, I can't believe people still think it wasn't a COMPLETE failure. \n\n\n\n", "author_flair_css_class": null}
