One consequence of this is that passphrases will be far easier to brute-force than random alphanumeric strings; the attacker simply has to go through the possible combinations of words from a dictionary, rather than cycling through every possible string.\n\nHere's a concrete example: with an eight character alphanumeric password with upper and lower case letters, there's [(26+26+10)^8 = 2.18340106 \u00d7 10^14](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%2826%2B26%2B10%29%5E8) possibilities; the attacker will on average have to try half of these to guess your password. With a passphrase based on words selected randomly from a 100000-word list (you should have such a list installed in /usr/share/dict/words), you'd need about 3 words ([2.8678267](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=ln%282.18340106+%C3%97+10%5E14%29%2Fln%28100000%29), to be exact) to get the same level of security as the random string password above. At an average word length of 8.44 letters, this would mean you'd need 25 characters of english (27 with spaces) to match the strength of the 8-character alphanumeric string.\n\nMind you, [eight random words](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=ln%28%2826%2B26%2B10%29%5E22%29%2Fln%28100000%29) might be easier for some people to remember than twenty-two random alphanumerics, which is the shortest password string equivalent in strength to a [128-bit key](http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=ln%282%5E128%29%2Fln%2826%2B26%2B10%29&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=).", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2fwo", "name": "t1_c02b8cv", "ups": 3, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5z2s9", "retrieved_on": 1427425418, "score_hidden": false, "body": "Except that passphrases tend to be... hum... phrases.
