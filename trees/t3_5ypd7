(Gibsales) \r\n\r\nA Limitless Revenue Sharing Plan where \"No one gets left behind\" (Gibline)\r\n\r\nOnce you Join Giblink at the Pro Level, here's what you won't need to do;\r\n\r\nSponsor Others\r\nSell anything to anyone\r\nHold or attend meetings, not one time, never!\r\nTravel to Rallies or Conferences\r\nKeep any stock or promotional materials\r\nSpend money on \"corporate\" promotional magazines or materials\r\nStop what you currently do. (In fact, you can use Giblink to promote what you do to the network. I have!)\r\nJoin Giblink Now\r\nThere Are Two Memberships: Standard and Pro. \r\n\r\nAt Standard level ($50.00 US), to move forward past Gibline one, you would sponsor two individuals activating Pro Level. \r\n\r\nAt Pro Level ($150.00 US) you are effectively sponsoring yourself twice and this qualifies you for all commissions in the compensation plan. No need to sponsor anyone else, ever.\r\n\r\nI strongly recommend that everyone who joins Giblink, to do so at the Pro Level. The extra advantages you will have available to you are certainly worth it and you will see your downlines absolutely explode with laser-targeted traffic.\r\n\r\nJoin Giblink Now\r\n\r\nSome Common Questions Being Asked: \r\n\r\nWhen and how are you paid? \r\n\r\nEach Wednesday. A new method by Direct Debit into a Card Account provided by Citibank and accessible world wide. Pay days are every Wednesday. If you qualify for commission, it will be directly credited to your account.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you cancel enrollment? \r\n\r\nYes. You have a 3 day review period. Join and see what happens. If you don't like what you see, just cancel. Comfort for those who want jump in now, but are still a little unsure.\r\n\r\nHas anyone been paid yet? \r\n\r\nYes, the first Commission run was at launch on October 15th. Giblink Management reports that the first run of commissions was over $1,000,000. That is a sensational starting point.\r\n\r\nWhen I rejoin, do I repay or is the charge taken from commissions? \r\n\r\nYou will be charged every 90 days from your credit card. Rejoin is every 90 days. Commission runs are weekly. There is an expectation commissions will be received on a far more regular basis than the 90 days rejoin period. \r\n\r\nWhen I rejoin can I chose another sponsor? \r\n\r\nNo. So choose wisely. Join Early with someone you can speak with. It\u2019s always a good idea to join someone\u2019s downline who you already know and trust. Having a strong upline will greatly determine your business success.\r\n\r\nIf I join at Standard, can I change it later or upgrade to Pro later?\r\n\r\nNo. You'd need to sign as a Pro member through yourself. It is easier, if budget allows to Join first time as a PRO ($150.00 US) Out of every person that has joined with me and the number is a healthy one, each person has joined at the Active Pro member Level\r\n\r\nWill there be a way to see what kind of money we have made or earned in our back office? \r\n\r\nYes. Back Office has a commission summary breaking down the revenue categories, the dollar amounts for each category, the amount you are being paid in the current week and the pending commission payable the next week. Additionally, the back office has a \"Gibline summary\" page that will show you the movement on the Gibline over a 7 day / 30 day period. It will also show you the number of \"pods\" above you and beneath you. Remember all pods above you will come in beneath you over the next 90 days as people rejoin.\r\nAlso listed is the total number of pods that you receive match bonuses on. That match is available on the first pod of every member you sponsor.\r\n\r\nAre there any new ways to make money?\r\n\r\nYes. Great news! As you sponsor people (if you choose to) you receive a $15 bonus for Pro members and a $5.00 bonus for Standard members. In a just made decision, these commissions will be paid on rejoins, so every 90 days, whomever you have sponsored will continue to pay you this bonus ongoing. So, if you sponsored say, 100 people in Giblink (don't be too surprised if you do) you'd be in line for $1500 every 90 days additional cash. That's in addition to the matching bonuses and any additional share bonuses for sponsoring ten plus members.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of experience do the four owners have in Network Marketing? \r\n\r\nTogether they have about 100 years of experience in this Industry.\r\n\r\nIs there Support from Giblink?\r\n\r\nYes, via the back Office Help Desk.\r\n\r\nThe Company is paying a 100% matching bonus for you for each person you sponsor. Your sponsor earns that bonus by helping their own people. Again, choose a sponsor who will be there to help you. (I get requests for help every day from folks who can not contact their sponsor for help)\r\n\r\nHow does that 100% matching Bonus work again?\r\n\r\nIf you choose to sponsor a person, as they move up through and launch out of \"goblins\" to the next level they will receive payment for doing so. As their first pod launches, the check they receive is matched to their sponsor. So, if they get $50, you get $50. If they get $10,000.00, you get $10,000. You match the first pod only. See Revenue Sharing Plan Link above right.\r\n\r\nAt Pro Level, who gets the match bonus on my other two pods?\r\n\r\nYou do. When you joined at Pro level, you effectively joined and immediately sponsored yourself twice.\r\n\r\nAt this time do we know how many people are in a Gibline at any one time?\r\n\r\nNot at this time. Many functions in the back office are being upgraded and we are seeing new pieces all the time being added. We will be able to see Gibline movement in back office soon.\r\n\r\nHow fast will Giblink grow?\r\n\r\nAnother difficult question. In pre-launch over 20,000 people joined within the first month at Pro Level. The growth, as best as I can track it, has been exponential. As more join, the natural progression is, more will share. This is happening fast. All registrations are time and date stamped and you take your position in the order in which you join, in real time.\r\n\r\nWill there be other product added to what I see in the Product Link Above right? \r\n\r\nYes, the plan is to allows have the best most up to date product available.\r\n\r\nWhere does all the money come from to pay members?\r\n\r\nFrom product sales, advertising, new memberships and rejoin fees. The Giblink site is getting over 1,000,000 hits per day. As hits increase, advertising value increases. And that means advertising revenue shared increases. This is another great reason to either get the word out and sponsor people or at least share the site with people. More hits - More Income for all. New products will be introduced.\r\n\r\nCan a person sponsor someone in his own family if he has a different email address? \r\n\r\nYes. If you see the potential in this and you have evaluated all the risks versus potential excitement, go ahead. Or just wait and see. Join Giblink Now\r\n\r\nWhat happens if I do not rejoin in 90 days?\r\n\r\nYou lose your position and all of your pods. It makes clear sense to evaluate your position in 90 days. This evaluation should be based upon the entire future potential, not what you think might happen in the next 90 days.\r\n\r\nIf unsure where you are and what your potential earnings are, contact your sponsor. Hopefully they are not in the \"witness protection program\". Join Giblink with someone you know you can contact later. Choose a person who will get you answers.\r\n\r\nCan you cancel your membership at any time? \r\n\r\nYes. There is a link in your back office that allows you to opt out.\r\n\r\nDo you have Servers big enough to handle a large membership? \r\n\r\nYes. New servers have already been purchased.\r\n\r\nJoin Giblink Now\r\n\r\nEmail me for Additional Launch Information\r\n\r\nI am here to work with people who are coachable, trainable, and who truly want to succeed.
