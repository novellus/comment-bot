No one is positing some overlord but human behavior cannot be divorced from its context.\n\nThe pattern many are observing is simply that men in greater numbers than women choose to pursue a career in academic sciences. This career has obvious hurdles and disadvantages. I left graduate school when I saw what it would mean for me in my 30s and 40s to be in an academic job. More than half of my professors seem to have sucky lives outside of their research (single, divorced, married but seemingly bland, no time for raising children, worried about job security, worried about moving elsewhere). I don't think that is true at the company where I work now or the people I meet in my life. The response that those who do science are those who are obsessed by it discounts what it means to live as a human that is acting upon many worlds and not just the one built within the walls of scientific discourse.\n\nNow. I think a proper treatment of this should be to consider other careers where the numbers differ between men and women. For instance, architecture seems to be a profession where very few people seem to be paid well and it takes many years to secure senior positions.

The article is correct that science is extremely competitive and difficult to succeed in. The author makes several implicit assumptions, however, regarding motivations and the definition of a \"good career\".\n\nNo matter how smart I am, there is a decent chance that I'll never become a professor at a top University. I knew that when I made the choice to go into science. That being said, I am *enjoying* my life as a graduate student. The work itself is very interesting and thought-provoking, even if it may eventually go nowhere. My salary is lower than many of my fellow recent graduates', but it is certainly high enough to support my lifestyle (and higher than that quoted in the article). There is a strong social component built into the academic community, and nearly everyone I meet is highly intelligent. Even if I never see a microscope again, I will regard this period as time well spent.\n\nTo paraphrase: my motivations are not particularly career-oriented, but rather to spend time doing something I enjoy with people I enjoy being around. Apparently Greenspun does not understand this concept.\n\nSecond, even if I were career-oriented, I'm not convinced that Greenspun's choices of \"better\" careers are actually any better. Doctors are certainly well paid, but they routinely work 24- or 36-hour shifts. (Scientists work long hours, but they can *choose* what those hours are. If I've been working too hard for a few days, no one stops me from going home at noon to take a nap - in fact, it is encouraged!) Several doctors have also advised me not to enter medicine because of the increasing emphasis on HMOs and insurance companies. Every career choice has its drawbacks, and if you list them all together at length (as Greenspun did for scientists), any of them can be made to sound disastrous.\n\nFinally, a Ph.D. in science can be a prerequisite for many things. Greenspun touches primarily upon going into academia, which is both highly difficult and highly rewarding. Losing that battle is not the end of the world, however; there are plenty of opportunities in science industry. Greenspun's dismissal of science industry jobs apparently stems from his observation that \"Very few volunteer jobs have the characteristics of an industrial science job.\" This argument is patently idiotic.\n\nEven if I do find myself unable to become a professor and unwilling to get a job in the science industry, with a Ph.D. in science, I can easily \"sell out\" and get a very high-paying job on Wall Street or at any number of companies. By doing science at a high level, I will already be familiar with a broad set of technologies and computational tools, and my degree will prove that I am both intelligent and capable of pushing a project to completion. I know many scientists and mathematicians who quit science at some point and were able to make a very good living in another career. And I don't think that any of them viewed their time in science as \"wasted\".\n\nSo, in short, to a person with the correct personality and some brains, science is intrinsically rewarding, graduate school is fun, academia is possible but not fundamentally necessary for fulfillment, science jobs are a solid alternative, and selling out for the big bucks is always an option.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5zhfh", "id": "c02cbwg", "author_flair_css_class": null}

I think this article certainly hits on some really good points, especially for those going into bio, however I can tell you that the pay in engineering (CHE esp.) is a lot better than what greespun makes it out to be. I make 26k as a grad student. If I go to industry, which I will, I will start at ~90k year. If I choose to go into mangagement later on, it will pay very nicely. If not, research group leaders in major chemical and oil companies make over 200k easily. CEO's, CTO's, etc, of most of the major oil and chemical companies are people with science and engineering degrees and obviously make a lot of bank. On the other hand, a post doc will likely pay around 40-50k at a university or 60k at a national lab. Full professors in my dept all make over 100k year, most of them in the 150-200k range. Though a starting Asst. position is around 75k. The head of my dept makes 285k base salary. Though, getting a well paying job in acedemics is a lot tougher than getting one in industry and the reason why a lot of the PhD's are not considering jobs in acedemia. \r\n\r\nHaving said that, as an engineer, I understand that if I want to be filthy rich, not just well off, I need to either start my own company or get into the buisess side of a chemical/oil company. Even though us scientisits and engineers are responsible for our current standard of living today, it's the MBA's, \"money shuffler's\", etc, who make the money off of our innovations. For example, at a company if you come up with something that gets commericalized, or something that improves the efficiency of a process that saves the comapany millions a year, the engineer will be lucky to get a good 5% raise that year, while the fat cat buiness people at the top of the company see huge gains in their income because their profit margins increased and therefore their stocks go up. \r\n\r\nI got into science and engineering because I want to help make the world a better place to live but I also want to make a lot of money doing it, which is not going to be easy.
