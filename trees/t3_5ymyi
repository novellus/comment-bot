If you see the beginnings of impetigo, see a physician. It usually takes a round of antibiotics to control even non MSRA staph infections. It usually starts as a small area of blistered skin that later gets a scablike crust on it. Not big blisters but lots of tiny ones. Regular staph impetigo does not get to a stage that becomes a boil or pimple like infection. The only case of MSRA staph infection that I saw, was on a wrestlers knee. He thought it was a pimple.\r\n\r\nSkin infections are common with wrestlers. The preventitve measures taken by the college wrestlers are frequent sterilization of mats, their clothing, and equipment that the westlers wear. They are required to shower after their events at the venue before they leave. Bleach is my favorite sanitizer.
