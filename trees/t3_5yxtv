Why is the \"finite age of stars\" solution grouped under alternative explanations instead of mainstream explanations? It is the most correct and pertinent solution in this article. Instead of mainstream and alternative explanations, there should be correct solutions and incorrect solutions. \n\n2. Why is it mentioned that the \"finite age of stars\" explanation is neither necessary nor sufficient, when the same is not mentioned (yet is also true) about the \"finite age of the universe\" explanation? \n\n3. \"Thus, the mainstream explanation of Olber's paradox requires a universe that is both finitely old and expanding.\" This is wrong, or at least, not entirely right. For example, keeping all other variables the same, an infinitely-aged and/or static universe would still have a dark night sky.\n\n4. The most correct and informative explanation is based on an energy argument. It overrides all these other explanations, but mysteriously it is unmentioned in the wikipedia article. Simply put, there is not enough energy (per unit volume) in the universe to create a bright night sky. \n\nEven if you converted all of the matter in the universe to light, the background temperature of the universe would only be raised to a mere 20 K, nowhere near the roughly 6000 K of Olber's Paradox (i.e. a night sky where every point is as bright as the surface of a star). In this thought-experiment, the universe would need on the order of 10 billion times more energy that it has now to produce a bright night sky. But in reality, it would require quite a few orders of magnitude more than that, because only a tiny fraction of matter is converted into starlight (first because only a small fraction of matter in the universe is contained in stars, and second because only a small fraction of stellar material is converted into starlight).\n\nThe people who wrote this article clearly did not read the most informative and important reference that they themselves mentioned: *Darkness at Night: A Riddle of the Universe* by Edward Harrison. Everything you need to know about this paradox is described beautifully in this book.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
