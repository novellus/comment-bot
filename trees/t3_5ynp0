Our bases occupy miles and miles of valuable land (a quarter of the entire island of Okinawa), and our troops wreak havoc on the countryside.  It doesn't make any sense!  How would we feel if the Chinese had 100,000 troops stationed in US soil and caused a fraction of the problems we caused over there?  We'd be fucking pissed.  I'm thinking (hoping) it won't be long until Japan says, \"You know what? Fuck you guys.\" and tells us to GTFO, treaty or no treaty.
