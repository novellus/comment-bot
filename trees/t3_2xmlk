How do these reporters sleep at night?\n\nTroop deaths are nearly halving for 4 months and the media buries it.  If it was *rising* troop deaths, they admit they'd report it, but their excuses include the following for not reporting this (except for ABC admittedly) boldly:\n\n1) 4 months is not a trend. (except when deaths are rising)\n\n2) The numbers are disputed (except when deaths are rising, then they never ask questions)\n\n3) Changes the subject to Shiite on Shiite violence when American troops are not even involved!\n\nThis makes me sick, frankly, and as usual, if it doesn't fit with a Leftist ideology, Redditors bury it.  Tells you a lot that so many can't even read or discuss things that doesn't fit their ideology.", "author": "isthis", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c02ces4", "parent_id": "t3_2xmlk", "id": "c02ces4", "author_flair_css_class": null}
