Philly. The friend asks the child to make up a story, and the story goes something like this:\n\n'Family gets together, plans to go out for dinner and a movie, they pack the things, dad says he'll meet them at the restaurant, he has an errand to run...'\n\nAll mundane to this point, of course, but the end of the story is:\n\n'The dad gets in his car and gets shot and dies. The end.'\n\nNow, as the friend recounts this, the girl was very matter-of-fact about this story, which was fictional. But, I think it's pretty telling of what's going on now in Philadelphia.\n\n---\n\nIt's really straight out of 'Lord of the Flies'. There are neighborhoods cops will not go to, because it's so violent. Time and time again, on the news, people continually lament that 'no one cares' - really, outside of the family, no one seems to be bothered that they're killing one another for the most inane of things.\n\nAnd getting a gun isn't difficult. Two inquirer reporters walked into Lou's on 69th Street, and in 45 minutes had two firearms (the place has subsequently stopped selling guns). \n\nIt's the vision of 'thug life' incarnate. Hearkening back to 'no one cares' - there's a fear and distrust of police officers that makes it more honorable not to snitch on the guy who killed your brother or sister. \n\nWith public schools privatized and no incentive to get better (because it can get you killed), N. Philly is doing its best impression of Detroit. On top of that, the city taxes are massive and the public services underwhelming, you have a continual exodus from the city to the suburbs making the city even poorer.\n\nNutter is going to have a lot on his hands... especially after John Street sat on his hands through his two terms.", "author": "mtxblau", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c029igz", "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c029igz", "parent_id": "t3_5yew6", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}
