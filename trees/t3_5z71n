You are right in the meaning of the individual words but probably a bit off in the interpretation. A mortgage meant the usufruit rights went to lender until repayment of the debt or death and it seems it is where the name directly comes from. However I find it very hard to believe that a term with such strongly negative connotations is purely coincidental and one needs to keep in mind that there is a strong French tradition (or was at least) of considering interest and other forms of the right of windfall as theft.\n\nOther fun facts: the term has fallen out of use in French for the more neutral \"hypoth\u00e8que\", but the French word for \"to work\" (travailler) comes from latin meaning to torture.
