That assured the upper elite (the top 1.5% of white americans) a source of cheap labor.

First, there is no relationship between the attack victim and the noose incident.  Whether the author is correct that this was some rodeo prank is an open question as far as I'm concerned -- the point to me is, it's irrelevant to the attack on a kid three months later who had nothing to do with the offensive act.  Over and over, this was sold as some sort of retribution.  In fact, nobody has credibly advanced any relationship between the tree incident and the attack.  \"My ascriptive group was offended ninety days ago\" is not a defense to aggravated assault, attempted murder, or any other violent felony of which I am aware.  Over and over, the charges against the attackers were sold as obvious overcharges unjustified by law and unprecedented in practice.  In fact, nobody ever discussed the attack, the extent of the injuries, the motives behind it, or anything at all bearing on what would be an appropriate charge under the circumstances.  \n\n\nWhat I'm saying is, a non sequitur is not really a \"myth\" to be countered with facts, so much as it is self-evidently nonsensical.", "author": "gmcg", "created_utc": "1193797935", "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "id": "c02cahd", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t1_c02c6mj", "name": "t1_c02cahd", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "ups": 1, "name": "t1_c02c6mj", "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5ze1x", "retrieved_on": 1427424973, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02c6mj", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02c2x0", "body": "do you agree with the substantive points of the article?

Seriously, show the media a noose, and here come the satellite trucks.  These guys are clinging to some 1950s metaphor that just completely misses the point of our current racial tensions, which have a lot more to do with the quality of the people in our schools than with the trees outside those schools.  The central line of this story was a plain non sequitur: nooses were hung outside a school in week A (ignoring the motivation behind that disturbing action), ergo a crime in week E was overcharged (ignoring that it was unrelated).  \n\n\nIt was just shocking to watch how many times the media parroted that line, and how steadfastly they avoided looking into the circumstances of the noose incident or the attack.  I mean, for all the assertions that \"these kids\" were railroaded and overcharged, nobody ever talked about the facts of the attack.  What mattered was that the story fit the mold the reporters and many of their viewers been carrying around since high school social studies.  I think the author's analogy to the Duke Lacrosse case is apt.  Facts are important, and this story, like the Dule Lacrosse story, is ultimately very damaging to marginalized groups, whose legitimate grievances get lost in sensationalist cable crap.  But it kept the war, the related profiteering, and the abysmal management of the economy out of the news for a few minutes.

Can the officials at a school with a rodeo team not tell the difference between a noose and a lasso?

I want a reason why i would believe it to be true, though.\n\n\"DA's threat to black students\" is somewhat indecipherable. The \"official\" story (that it's a DA's threat to black students) makes much more sense--maybe too much sense!--than the rambling nonsense presented.

The whole story's *about* bias, and while it's naive to think the \"outside\" media is totally objective, it's much more so to think that this guy doesn't have an opinion on the matter.\n\nThis reminds me a lot of one of the other locals writing about how the media got it wrong - a pastor who referred to most of the white people in the story by name, but none of the black people.
