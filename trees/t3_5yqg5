That is classic demand theory. It doesn't matter who is buying the oil, the price will go up if demand goes up.\n\nI don't know how the US strategic oil reserve system works. I am going to assume that it is paid for and owned by the government. As we all know, the US government squanders the fortunes of its citizens on military spending. It spends as much on \"defence\" as the rest of the world combined.\n\nTo pay for this spending the government prints money in the form of treasury bonds and relies on oversees buyers (such as the federal reserve banks of other countries) to buy this printed money.\n\nIncreasing the money supply (through printing money); whether you physically print more bank notes (as is the recent history in Zimbabwe) or sell treasury bonds; raises inflation and devalues the currency. This is classic money supply theory.\n\nIt might be argued that all this government military spending will \"pump-prime\" the economy and raise the well being of everyone. If the government puts out a contract to build ships that leads to the building of a shipyard, lots of jobs for people who then go out and spend that money on goods and services, better homes and cars, giving more work to other people, which in turn pumps more demand into the economy.\n\nThe reality is that the net benefit of the USA's absurd level of military spending is a net drain on the economy. Because other countries don't waste anywhere near as much money on defence, their governments can use their tax revenues on more productive economic and social infrastructure such as education, health care and the general social and scientific progression of their societies, such as implementing the metric system.\n\nNow, if on top of all that wasted money spend on defence, dragging down the productivity of the US economy and its competitive advantage with the rest of the word, the government goes out and decides to spend a lot more money on oil stockpiles you can see that is going to raise the demand for oil and increase the price. This is a direct inflationary pressure on the economy because  oil is a direct or indirect input to every stage in the production and distribution chain.\n\nThe increased government spending on the strategic oil stockpile needs to be paid for. Because the US federal government squanders such an outrageous amount of money on military spending it has to \"print\" money by printing and selling treasury bonds to overseas investors. This indirectly promotes inflation by inflating the money supply. It also deteriorates the country's current account balance. In effect the government is printing treasury bonds, selling them (in US dollar denomination) to overseas lenders and then using that borrowed money to pay foreign suppliers of oil.\n\nThe USA ends up with inflation, a lower dollar and accumulates more and more debt that it will never pay off and for which the consequences continue to snowball. Insufficient government spending on economically productive infrastructure, education, health, social order and cohesion, social justice.\n\nWhen you consider this it is only bleeding obvious that oil costs more to buy in $US. In very crude terms (without calculating the exact figures) the price of oil in Australian dollars ($AU) has not gone up this year. This is because the $AU has appreciated against most world currencies and of course, appreciably against the falling $US. So while oil prices are up in terms of $US (oil is traded in $US), because the $US is depreciating against the $AU and other international currencies, in effect the price of oil when converted to $AU has not risen much this year at all.\n\nThe demand for oil goes up - the price goes up. If the government prints money the value of the currency falls and inflation goes up. The US$ is worth less, it costs Americans more to import oil.
