(2) Chronologically I am a post-Baby Boomer. I feel that way, at least, because I never experienced the fun and exciting parts of the whole Boomer scene--just spent a lot of time dutifully chuckling at Boomers' maddeningly pointless anecdotes about just how stoned they got on various occasions, and politely fielding their assertions about how great their music was. But even from this remove it was possible to glean certain patterns, and one that recurred as regularly as an urban legend was the one about how someone would move into a commune populated by sandal-wearing, peace-sign flashing flower children, and eventually discover that, underneath this facade, the guys who ran it were actually control freaks; and that, as living in a commune, where much lip service was paid to ideals of peace, love and harmony, had deprived them of normal, socially approved outlets for their control-freakdom, it tended to come out in other, invariably more sinister, ways.\n\nApplying this to the case of Apple Computer will be left as an exercise for the reader, and not a very difficult exercise.\"\n\n-- Neal Stephenson, _In The Beginning Was The Command Line_", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2fwo", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 6, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5zhkf", "retrieved_on": 1427424897, "body": "Apfel Apfel uber alles?", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "name": "t1_c02ccid", "parent_id": "t1_c02caj3", "id": "c02ccid", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "programming", "ups": 2, "name": "t1_c02caj3", "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5zhkf", "retrieved_on": 1427424923, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02caj3", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5zhkf", "body": "Geez, if it were anybody but John Gruber defending Apple, I'd probably listen, but he'd defend Apple if they decided to annex the Sudetenland and invade Poland.\n", "author_flair_css_class": null}
