We've got a right to talk!\" she said\n\nFuck that! I pay rent and I have a right to sleep, think, work, read, or watch tv in peace. I'm a fusty neighbor from way back but when I was younger I only weighed 135 lbs and wore ridiculously large glasses. Once I got some gray hair, contacts, and toned 190 lbs, people started saying \"Yes sir, sorry sir.\"\n\nIt's usually the girls who talk back. One of them even had the nerve to ask me what I was doing up so late! But sometimes guys will go ballistic, so it's best to let the authorities deal with it. Nowadays I just call the apartment security folks.\n\nI thought I was the only one \"brave\" enough to do this, but once after I had given some noisy neighbors what I thought was ample time to wind down, I started to call on them only to hear Security pounding on their door. I was thrilled to have neighbors even less tolerant than me!\n ", "author": "mutatron", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "id": "c029m7h", "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": "t3_5yh04", "name": "t1_c029m7h", "author_flair_css_class": null}
