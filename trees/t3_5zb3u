HTML+CSS\n2. Javascript\n3. LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)\n4. beyond...\n\nYou *must* learn HTML and CSS at the same time. I recommend that because it is very easy to learn to use HTML wrong if you don't see, from the beginning, the uses of CSS. Find a book that teaches both at once (or an online tutorial, if you must, but be wary of the tutorial's quality).\n\nI consider Javascript to be slightly less important than the other technologies, but I place it at step 2 because it serves as a wonderful introduction to programming in addition to being pretty useful by itself.\n\nYou need the experience in programming from learning Javascript when you move on to LAMP, which is a necessary step for stepping into server-side programming. Make a simple web application like a blog. If you are fairly quick, you can learn Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP as you go.\n\nAfter this point, I recommend you learn something besides PHP. PHP is a terrible language, encouraging the worst in programmers. The only reason I recommend starting with it is because it is so popular and its documentation is superb. The current fad seems to be Ruby or Python, although Java seems to own most of the corporate world. In most circumstances, it is probably easiest to start with a web framework such as Ruby on Rails. I only pick that one out because it is the biggest fad at this point, not because it is necessarily the best.\n\nOnce you have gotten here, you probably have learned enough to be able to experiment with other technologies with much less guidance.\n\nBest of luck!", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "parent_id": "t3_5zb3u", "id": "c02bvmq", "author_flair_css_class": null}

It turns out that after years of programming, the languages I know best are the languages that I did not start learning with an IDE. Start by building a very basic webpage by hand, using notepad or emacs or something. Learn to include the html and body tags, and learn how to make text links and put pictures in the page. then learn all the attributes of the tags you use. The body tag for instance, has many different options to configure your page, and that is only one tag. Once you figure out all that, you can see how css ties in by creating a template for the tags you use most. once you figure out css and are familiar with tags and how they can be embedded in other tags, take a stab at learning JSP. you can download the tomcat application server for free, and learn to use that. You can also learn to program in java, which will have direct application to jsp development. Javascript is pretty nutty to start out with. dont mess a whole lot with javascript until you fully understand the Document Object Model and the idea that webpages are very much asynchronous entities.  good luck.. and use google. \n\n", "author_flair_css_class": null}
