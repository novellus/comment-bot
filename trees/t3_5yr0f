The kid was so bad that several of the students thanked me for what I did.\n\nKid tells principal I touched him and spoke of my desire for him.\n\nImagine being told that at the end of a school day!!! \n\nLuckily, the principal was a seasoned veteran. He could have picked up the phone and called law enforcement, resulting in my going to jail and having my name and image slathered across the media.... effectively ruining my life locally.\n\nInstead, he called in a parent and spoke to them. He also questioned the kids that were in the classroom when the alleged event took place (I did not know about all this, not learning of the accusation until the end of the school day).\n\nThe principal sent the kid home telling the kid and parent there would be another meeting the next morning.\n\nI did not sleep that night. I felt physically ill. I searched the Web and found many horror stories about people falsely accused, some proving their innocence, some found guilty, and too many imprisoned but found innocent later..... and a few incarcerated, who may or may not have been truly guilty, killed or maimed in prison by other prisoners.\n\nI did not go to school the next day... I was mentally and physically unable to perform my duties.\n\nI awaited the principal's phone call and when the phone shouted.... my gut was wrenching as I awaited the results of that morning session.\n\nHow can I describe the relief when the principal told me the truth was revealed? The kid admitted that every thing he accused me of was a lie intended to keep him from getting in trouble for his horrid classroom behavior.\n\nI was also told that the child was known to have \"problems\" and was a \"special ed kid\" receiving in-school treatments for behavioral issues. \n\nIn an earlier era that kid would not have been mainstreamed into regular classes, he would have been kept apart for his own good and to protect teachers and other students from his behavioral problems.\n\nI was a substitute teacher and was not in-the-know about which students were a threat as the regular teachers knew. To protect themselves, many teachers will not do ANY action that would anger a behaviorally-challanged student so as to avoid incidents of the type I write of.\n\nYes, the kid admitted I had done NOTHING inappropriate.... all I had done was my job.\n\nYet, by doing my job....I faced the worst event of my life. \n\nOh the power kids have over teachers. Yes, there are bad teachers but how about the bad students that can and, at times, do ruin an innocent teacher's life?\n\nThe kid's punishment? A few days in-school suspension. Having to eat lunch separated from other kids. Spending a half-hour in the office after school dismisses.\n\nIf the kid had not told the truth... what would have been my punishment if I had not been able to prove my innocence? And, even if I did, my life would still be marred to a certain extent due to the media coverage and beliefs of a certain percentage of the local populace.\n\nPardon my long-windedness but I wanted to show the \"other side of the story.\"\n\nThank you for reading this.\n\n(for the record, I no longer sub teach for that school district that has a high percentage of disturbed kids due to the local demographics of the area....lots of adult drug use and drinking, many kids with fetal alcohol syndrome, many broken homes... I can accurately proclaim that 'white trash' is the norm for that area) ", "author_flair_css_class": null}
