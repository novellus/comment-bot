Also, more recently, have ammo.  There are a lot of reports of ammo supply being scarce.  Plan for the government to be gun-seizure happy during any \"emergency\"\n\n2) Have gold and food storage.  It seems that every tyrannical dictatorship just but can't help to ruin their money, and ruin their food supply and distribution system.  You absolutely must have enough to outlast the rest of the population long enough to create an exit strategy.  Keep your assets out of the bank and the financial system, and pay in cash whenever you can.  Be aware at all times that the government is seizure happy, plan for that and don't keep all your eggs in one basket.\n\n3) Have a private mail box and do everything possible to make it so that no one knows your real address.  Which is very hard now days, by the way.\n\n4) Have a digital phone for similar reasons, and don't register your real address with it.  Learn about technology, especially ssh, gpg - encryption software, and proxy servers.  Also, open source software is probably better than closed source which is more vulnerable to being co-opted by governments.  If you can, have some type of server access outside the country.  \n\n5) Have a passport.  Even if the US blocks all exits.  You will still need it to get around from place to place if you ever escape.  Also remember, the govt will likely be very seizure happy at all exit points.\n\n6) If you can afford it, have a place or land in another continent.  Having some cash and assets waiting over there would be good too.  Having some of your assets in foreign accounts is good too. Avoid other countries that are puppets of the USA - and would sell you out to them quickly.  BTW, countries with a strong dependence on tourism or banking sectors are probably not safe.\n\n7) Have a relocation strategy.  Even if you can't leave the country, the USA is a big place.  Wherever you go, you will want to go where there not trouble or much activity.  The key is blend in.  Avoid congested areas that will likely have violence and \"round ups\".\n\n8) Keep an eye on the blogs and the main stream media.  Whatever they do, they will likely need to make a bunch of puffed up excuses first.  Watch for it.  Watch for any activity that restricts entrance or exits to geographical locations. \n", "author": "argoff", "created_utc": "1193610249", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "archived": true, "id": "c02bumx", "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 3, "parent_id": "t3_5zb60", "name": "t1_c02bumx", "author_flair_css_class": null}
