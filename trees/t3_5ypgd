The average size had been increasing over time, but this year is smaller than last year which was a record high. And, yes, every year it does in fact shrink and comes back and expands the next year. The ozone hole is caused by CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons) such as Freon which have absolutely nothing to do with Global Warming which is caused by greenhouse gasses such as carbon dioxide and methane. If you bothered to read the article you\u2019d learn that the hole shrinks because of warmer weather plus we\u2019ve cut down on CFCs in the atmosphere showing that we may be doing something right since the hole is down in size from last year. It never ceases to amaze me how conservatives grasp at straws like the fact that the ozone hole expands and then contracts to argue against a completely unrelated phenomenon, Global Warming. It must be because they realize that they\u2019re going to Hell and they want any possible excuse for their not spending eternity wailing and gnashing their teeth as Satan sodomizes them. Oh, well, I guess you gotta cling to something.", "author": "IrishJoe", "created_utc": "1192845440", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5ypgd", "id": "c02a6w8", "author_flair_css_class": null}
