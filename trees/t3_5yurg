It isn't that Apple is saying we won't support any version of the Java runtime, ever?  They are saying they won't support Java6 on their current release of their operating system.  Java6 was released Dec 2006.  So that really only gives Apple so many months to put that tool into their product, it is no wonder it wasn't included.  Or maybe it was just a big screw YOU, to Sun.\r\n\r\nWith that being said, is this guy really using the Java6 features like JDBC4 and smart card IO library?  Won't 99.999% of his code and applications run with JDK5.  And I guess that whole write-once-run-anywhere doesn't apply anymore, heaven forbid he have to **gasp** buy a PC (Linux or Win) and develop on it if he really needs those Java6 features.\r\n\r\nIs this what developers worry about these days?\r\n\r\nOn second thought, I dont want to understand it.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
