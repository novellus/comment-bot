I said it was fine and I made a big mistake. I called them 2 days later to check on the package since the online tracking was down on the site I ordered it from and I never got a tracking number. They said it was on time and I was ok with it. Then they called me at 10 AM and requested I drive 1 hour away to the DHL place and pick up the package since DHL could not make it. I was furious since my client needed the GPU in 16 hours then. I tried to get them to deliver it that day but after 2 hours of struggling I gave up and drove over there and they gave me alot of hassles over it. I had to have 3 forms of ID to pick up the package! I only need 2 to get an apartment!! I only had two so I used a bill I dugg up in my car and it worked. I was so mad when I got home to find out the GPU didn't work. I told the client this and he was ok with it and just gave me an extra 30 bucks for the work I did and I got a better one off newegg and returned this one and shipped it with fedex.
