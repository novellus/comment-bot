(Look close, that is 18, not 19)   \r\n\r\nThere is also a lot of progress on bio-fuels.  Ethanol, and biodiesel are both in current use, and growing (corn based ethanol is about tapped out though).    Algae biodiesel looks promissing, as does celluose ethanol (both are somewhat likely to start large scale production in 4 years if the research scales as well as we think it will).\r\n\r\nThen there is coal to liquid (which Germany managed to scale up pretty quickly in WWII, so we know it works) and related technologies.   In fact most modern Coal power plants use variations of this (combined cycle), because it is more efficent to turn coal to natural gas and burn that in a turbine, than to burn the coal directly in a boiler to produce steam.   It is trivial to turn biomass into coal.\r\n\r\nSolar power is coming down in price fast.   People who live in sunny areas (Southwest US for example) really should be putting in solar now because the payoff is so good.  Wind power is growing quickly as well.   \r\n\r\nHow will the future turn out?   You will have to wait for the future to find out.   I intentionally ignored problems with the above technologies, but they are sometimes significant. We know all of the above work, so the only question is can we maintain our current standard of living when they reach their real potential.  \r\n\r\nI hope it works out.  I'm looking for ways to help them along - unfortunatly it seems that I'm not alone, and some investors are trying to throw more money than needed into some of the above so it is a waste for me to add more.   (investors seem to be losing interest so now might be the time to start getting in) I just want to maintain my current standard of loving for the rest of time life - which could be 70 more years based on family history.", "author": "bluGill", "created_utc": "1193691465", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c02c18r", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_c02c10d", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"controversiality": 0, "id": "c02c259", "subreddit": "politics", "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 1, "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5zd6u", "retrieved_on": 1427425031, "score": 1, "body": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465031161\n\nhttp://oilendgame.com/", "author": "rollingdivision", "created_utc": "1193700389", "downs": 0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02c10d", "name": "t1_c02c259", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "ups": 1, "name": "t1_c02c10d", "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5zd6u", "retrieved_on": 1427425047, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02c10d", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02c0f0", "body": "for every article that says it wont affect us, there are 1000 that say we are in danger of a full blown depression, even social breakdown.  \n\nare you making this statement based on something you have read, or are you just assuming this is how it will work?", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1427425044, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "created_utc": "1193691855", "ups": 1, "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5zd6u", "downs": 0, "score": 1, "id": "c02c1ai", "author": "mrmikewikowski", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c02c1ai", "parent_id": "t1_c02c0f0", "body": "Unlikely.
