Vinyl can never contain all of the data present in the *master tape*. The CD represents that data faithfully (in the frequencies you can hear), with less added noise than vinyl. It's just that vinyl enthusiasts like how vinyl *distorts* the master tape sound.\r\n\r\nThe author does have a point about the amount of compression used in pop music these days. But if FM radio becomes less important (and consolidation to a few play lists may help that along), then fan-driven bands may not be as interested in making their music sound as loud as the next song and we can get back to music with interesting dynamic range.
