AAA here in Cincinnati is a non-profit that should be competing on the same level field as other travel agencies but they are not. And a lot of the poplular televangelists could probably take a 30% -40% hit in revenue and still be rich.  But I would say they are the exception.\n\nThe exemption puts non profits in possession of funds they would not otherwise have: Agreed?\nNo, donations and their own work puts them in possession of these funds and here I think, is the rub.  You somehow see the government as putting them in possession of funds they already had by virtue of the fact that the government is taking less from them.  Exactly this is our point of contention.  And you go on to state that government services is a form of funding.  That they are in effect taking a slice of the pie while the rest of us foot the bill.  \n\nSo we are left to argue about the slice of pie they are taking.\n\nNon-profits then use those monies to fund their operations at their own discretion: Agreed?\nYes, unqualified, Yes.\n\nThough they pay no tax non-profits consume public services at the same rate as tax payers: Agreed?\nNo, they do not consume public services at the same rate.  I am not sure that they consume public resources as a separate entity from taxpayers, because much more often than not(a point I only have anecdotal evidence for) non-profits are run by tax-paying individuals.  Jesse Jackson may not pay taxes, but every Scoutmaster in America does pay taxes because Scoutmaster is a volunteer position, and I can't think of a Scoutmaster who in in his daily vocation pays taxes.\n What you fail to understanding is that most non-profits are an avocation and not the primary source of income for a majority of it's members.  \nThe burden of proof is on you that the non-profits consume public services.  If I run a business that pays taxes, and I am also scoutmaster of a local boy scout troop.  I am spending my time and my own money to participate. Running the troop operates on what revenue it can bring in with dues and bake sales and the like.  I don't see the troop consuming government services.  It looks like they pay their own way, all the way.   Not everyone operating an organization consumes government resources.  Some consume none.  So I cannot agree with you unless you can provide concrete examples.  I don't think the government should be in the business of providing money for any public service organization.  They can facilitate it by getting out of the way, but the notion that someone who pays taxes wants to start a charitable organization must pay taxes again or be considered freeloaders on the backs of other taxpayers is unsubstantiated unless you can demonstrate where the government is directly spending money or manpower.  \n\nI think here is exactly where we disagree.\nAn organization's existence alone does not imply that they are consuming government resources.   \nYou say that they are, while I say that they aren't.\n\nRegardless those services must be paid for: Agreed?  I think you and I could generally agree that there will always be certain services that must be handled by the government and that they must be paid for.  With that qualification I agree.\n\n\nAs a side note, thanks for the civil debate.

Subsidizing and funding are two different things that both pertain to money.  Sometimes in the example of farm subsidies, there is payment of funds.  You could call that funding or subsidizing without much disagreement.  Here's the rub, when I don't receive any payment, I may still be subsidized in other manners, but I am not funded or financed by anyone.  I'm tired of people like yourself who try to make it sound like churches and other non-profits are being paid for by the government.  That is disinformation.  When I get a tax break for my kids, that doesn't mean the government is funding my family, it means I'm paying less taxes.  I fail to see how someone who is taking less from me is actually giving me something.  Maybe making a shit sandwich less shitty is still giving me something.  \nFunding will never be the same as a tax break, or a subsidy, though a subsidy can include funding.  For the raw logic.  If funding then subsidy is true while if subsidy then funding is false.  \nF--&gt;S  does not necessarily imply S--&gt;F\n\nCheers, \nh2.

Just because money isn't going one way in the form of taxes does not necessarily mean that it is going the other in the form of funding.  Your whole concept that they are getting something for free really does not amount to much in dollar terms.\n  Non-profits were set up as a way of fostering organizations that benefit society, so the government didn't have to get in the charity business.  The government isn't going to pay them to get in the charity, social welfare and well-being(YMCA) business, but it can agree not to take from them.\n\nI'd like to bill on the list of services non-profits receive.  If you are going to put a zero sum spin on non-profits, you need to add it all up and not just the costs you are so certain are significant.  Outside of televangelists, I don't know of too many religious organizations that are wealthy and stingy.  95% of the people involved in non-profits and churches are paying taxes in some way shape or form.  Churches don't pay property taxes, but most churches contribute back to society without billing for services.

He and his peers, both boys and girls, seem to alternate between playing role playing games, to chasey, to playing sports like basketball and touch footy.  Anyone who wants to play is invited, whether they be prepies (the really littlies) or a grade 6, male or female.

It is the BSAs prerogative as a private organisation to choose who they please.  However, this is why my child will never be a scout, well that and he has a gay uncle who is a fantastic human being who he loves dearly and I wouldn't stand for anyone suggesting that there is something wrong or evil with his uncle, because there isn't.\n\nI will however disagree with your comment regarding religion being good for children.  I wholeheartedly disagree with this, as a child of a pair of fantastic, loving, responsible agnostics, I felt loved and knew I was special without invoking a god like entity.

I and thousands of other functioning members of society are living proof that kids need love and boundaries from parents who celebrate them as individuals and intelligent human beings, not the carrot and the stick from a church who wants children to fit the mold of a \"good Christian\" and follow the leader, without question.

One reason is that 95% of children will grow to be heterosexual adults and need a frame of reference to show them how heterosexual relationships work.  Typically the husband is stronger and handles the heavy lifting and the wife is better at domestic duties.  I know that car maintenance and cutting down trees is my responsibility because I grew up watching my father handle those things.  My wife sucks at those things, and I suck at ironing the clothes and decorating.  We each have things that we are good at because of our gender, and we learned how to make that arrangement work by observing the role models we had when we were young.\n\nThe [mission of the Boy Scouts of America](http://www.scouting.org/nav/enter.jsp?s=mc&amp;c=fs)   is to prepare young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law.\n\nThe entire point of the organization is \"to prepare young people to make ethical and moral choices\".  So it's not a huge surprise that people who *don't* make ethical and moral choices aren't chosen as leaders.\n\nThe Scout Oath starts with the words \"On my honor I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country\".  It is inherently a religious organization.  So it stands to reason that atheists would not be selected as role models.  Atheism runs counter to the purpose of the organization.\n\nMore generally, without regard to the Boy Scouts, children benefit from having a religion.  Each child is tremendously special and kids flourish with the knowledge that they are special and that God loves them.  Kids that know that are more grounded than kids who don't, and if you are depriving your kids of that then you aren't giving them the best life available to them.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "ups": 1, "name": "t1_c02a7gd", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5ymqp", "retrieved_on": 1427425967, "score_hidden": false, "body": "Ahh.. so you're saying I'm immoral because I'm an atheist.
