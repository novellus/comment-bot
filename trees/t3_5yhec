The silencer and side panel are borrowed from Karizma. The headlight resemble the Achiever and the rear mudguard from pulsar and has a supporting frame from inside to prevent it from rattling. Overall looks a lot more muscular much better than CBZ xtreme. The bike has to be seen in flesh and look much better than that in the pics.\n\nThe hunk has the same engine as that of the CBZ extreme pumping out same power.\n\nThe kick-star would be available at Rs 55,000, the company would charge a premium of Rs 2,000 for the self-start model which is priced at Rs 57,000.", "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5yhec", "name": "t1_c02bom0", "author_flair_css_class": null}
