People in prison for drug-related charges will be released and returned to the economy. Capable and skilled military personnel will return to school or the economy. People will be free to be capitalists, create wealth, prosper, and enjoy their liberties.\n\nAlso, with no *income* tax on your earnings, you will feel liberated and the economy will \"long tail\". Imagine having to not report a single cent that your have worked hard to earn. What money a limited government needs to function can still be raised though tariffs and excise taxes.\n\nCorporate welfare and insane economic incentives (like farm subsidies) will be ended. There are no \"unintended consequences\" in a truly free market.\n\nRon Paul is the open source candidate, and his viral ideas are like the GPL.\n", "author_flair_css_class": null}
