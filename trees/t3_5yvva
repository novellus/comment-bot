It's ok, and even a little healthy to question authority. If there is a process/rule/law that is stupid, don't just bitch about it, work to change it.\n\n2. Student Loans suck. First of all, exhaust your financial aid options before getting a loan. If you do get a loan, don't spend the money on frivolous things (like going out drinking, or buying that new fancy cell phone/xbox). It seems like a good idea, but when you are paying that loan back for the next 10-20 years, you'll regret it. Student loans can be good for somethings, like buying a cheap car, where you would otherwise be paying a lot higher interest rate.\n\n3. In college, unless your financial aid requires a certain grade level, don't worry too much about grades. As long as you pass, and are learning the content of the courses, just have fun. \n\n4.

The long-term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists, whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience.

But trust me, in 20 years, you'll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. You are not as fat as you imagine.\n\nDon't worry about the future. Or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind, the kind that blindside you at 4 p.m. on some idle Tuesday.\n\nDo one thing every day that scares you.\n\nSing.\n\nDon't be reckless with other people's hearts. Don't put up with people who are reckless with yours.\n\nFloss.\n\nDon't waste your time on jealousy. Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind. The race is long and, in the end, it's only with yourself.\n\nRemember compliments you receive. Forget the insults. If you succeed in doing this, tell me how.\n\nKeep your old love letters. Throw away your old bank statements.\n\nStretch.\n\nDon't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don't.\n\nGet plenty of calcium. Be kind to your knees. You'll miss them when they're gone.\n\nMaybe you'll marry, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary. Whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much, or berate yourself either. Your choices are half chance. So are everybody else's.\n\nEnjoy your body. Use it every way you can. Don't be afraid of it or of what other people think of it. It's the greatest instrument you'll ever own.\n\nDance, even if you have nowhere to do it but your living room.\n\nRead the directions, even if you don't follow them.\n\nDo not read beauty magazines. They will only make you feel ugly.\n\nGet to know your parents. You never know when they'll be gone for good. Be nice to your siblings. They're your best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future.\n\nUnderstand that friends come and go, but with a precious few you should hold on. Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle, because the older you get, the more you need the people who knew you when you were young.\n\nLive in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard. Live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft. Travel.\n\nAccept certain inalienable truths: Prices will rise. Politicians will philander. You, too, will get old. And when you do, you'll fantasize that when you were young, prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders.\n\nRespect your elders.\n\nDon't expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you have a trust fund. Maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse. But you never know when either one might run out.\n\nDon't mess too much with your hair or by the time you're 40 it will look 85.\n\nBe careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it.

Don't listen to any of these schmucks about how you should/should not have ridiculous amounts of sex. That's your personal decision and yours alone.\n\n2. Visit the schools you apply to. Only so much can be conveyed about a school through a pamphlet/website/phone recruiter - and you'd better be sure as hell that perspective is a meticulously crafted one. Go and see it for yourself before you commit.\n\n3. Don't worry too much about going to a competitive school with a world-renowned reputation...even if you are worried about getting into other schools after you graduate. I went to a very small liberal arts college for my undergrad and now I am a PhD candidate at an Ivy League university in a highly competitive biology program. Truth be told, your grades that you earn during your four years, as well as the recommendations you get from people for your graduate school applications are what truly count. \n\n4. Don't get scared about picking the \"right\" major, and don't let anyone muscle you into something you don't like. If you need the time, take the time to declare. You have one to two years before most schools will even let you. But...do devote a lot of time think about it. Don't put it off. Oh, also, follow a career pathway that you enjoy, not something that is/will be \"hot\" or \"profitable\" or \"lucrative.\" It may or may not stay that way, and I'll tell you firsthand that if you do not have a passion for what you do, it will make your life more challenging than it should be and you most likely will not have the stamina and happiness that make you feel fulfilled at the end of the day.\n\n5. Remember...your life will be built in baby steps and don't feel like you have to plan everything perfectly right now. Just be willing to accept change and to work for positive things in your life and you will do just fine.\n\n6. And don't forget to take time for yourself! College demands a lot of self-discipline in order to go to classes and complete your assignments, etc. and it is very easy to get so caught up in it that you forget to take sanity time. And it will catch up with you. So chill with friends, go hiking, or play extreme frisbee...whatever makes you happy and puts you back in touch with your core being.\n\nBest of luck to you!", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5yvva", "id": "c02aooo", "author_flair_css_class": null}

First off, that is pretty good so far. I took time off after high school - I wasn't sure what I wanted to study. Also, I had no real help from my family. So, when I could, I went back and sloooooowwwwwwwwllllllllllyyyy finished my first degrees in college. \n\nWhat I would have liked to know:\n\nNo matter how much it costs - get the best education at the most prestigious institution you can imagine! I did not say \"afford\" - I said imagine. The exposure to powerful concepts and connections can not compete at a mediocre or lesser school. I suffered my whole life not realizing my own intelligence because of my surroundings. That is, those around me did not have the drive to go to college and were not able to help me get there. So, if you can get there with help and not as a complete bootstrapper, get through young, that is a huge advantage and a step in the right direction.\n\nHowever, you are 16. Only 16. One distinct advantage to having been an older student is this: I got way more out of it because I had the life experience to know what to try to get out of it. Most of the younger people I have met may be brilliant students but they won't know how fortunate they are for years to come down the road. That is not to say they should feel bad. Just, keep your eyes and ears open. Try to learn all you can through your own observations and curiosity. Learn to be that guy down the road who doesn't ask questions twice because you learned the lesson the first time. Trust me, now as an architect, managing projects, most of these young guys don't seem that smart. They don't listen and they still act like they are on their mommie's teat. It is very annoying to your bosses if they have to hold your hand so much.\n \nAlso, the sex thing, it is true. It is so easy. We were all afraid of AIDS when I was growing up. It was so Victorian. But, if you keep it nice and lite and smooth, it is easy. Enjoy yourself. Don't worry about punk-ass trends and perceptions. The weakest people are the ones that worry about what others think. They tend to melt away or take middle management positions (See Office Space). Original thinkers HAVE to become strong. Chicks dig strength.\n\nI say, become an Architect, if you want to become a strong man. Or, poli-sci or something that forces you to get up in front of crowds and become comfortable with yourself enough to try to win them over. That is tough to do when it comes to things, ideas, concepts which are your own - very personal. That kind of vulnerability can make you feel a little insane. In the end, nothing will ever be that hard again. So, like me, then you can take over the planet.\n\nAlways, reject fear and negativity. No one will ever succeed at anything if they listen to all the times someone says \"no\" or \"that can't possibly be done\". Believe you are an inventor and get out there and invent. Many creative iconic figures have been shot down repeatedly over the years which has only worked to steady their resolve. This should definitely not just be your mantra for working nor skoolin' neither. In life, that is where the real success is waiting. Every superstar I have ever met, every famous golden boy that I have worked with or for, has gotten a big leg-up from FRIENDS and CONNECTIONS. I regret not having been social enough in school (never mind that I was too busy working to pay the bills - I should have tried even harder). You gotta love life and not be afraid of it. Don't be afraid of dying, either, it is no way to live. When your friends tell you to jump off a cliff, fucking do it. Okay, not really literally. But, don't ever let yourself pass up an opportunity that you will later regret. I can't say what is safe or acceptable. Just trust your gut. If it ever starts to grumble, chances are that something ain't right. Listen to it.\n\nHey, is this really for some kid? I am an idiot.

If you go to a public university, these can translate into credit hours and easy GPA points. Even if you just get credit, that might be an extra \"fun\" class you get to take, instead of a dry, required intro class.\n\n**Take SAT II's** This is the same thing as above, except they're cheaper (I think?) and probably easier. Sometimes, they work out better, too. To get out of a math credit from my Calculus BC AP, I'd have had to take a semester of calculus, but because I'd scored well on my math SAT II (which was much easier) I got out of taking any math courses.\n\nBecause of the two things above, I had a 4.0 and 35 hours or so before I even took my first college class. This allowed me to take some exploratory classes my freshman year, although I'm now a double major and have a minor, I've got enough credits that I only need to take twelve hours a semester without sweat. This not only makes it easier for me to get my school work done (and to do it better), it gives me more non-classtime, and it makes it much easier to...\n\n**Get a job** Okay, maybe not your first semester. And maybe not the most *fun* thing to do, but honestly, I've made better friends at many of jobs than in my classes. Additionally, this gives you at least some feeling of real independence, and even if you're working to support yourself, it gives you a little bit of money that is all *yours* to spend however you like. My parents support me, but I hate asking for money, and having a job gives me a little bit of fun money, plus enough to cover all my bills (my parents are sweet and pay my rent). The first job seems to be the worst, so get it over with so you can do something \"cooler\" in college--or at least get paid a little bit more. \n\n**Go wherever you want to go for college** and visit before you accept the admission offer. I was accepted to Pomona College in California, which is a great and very selective college, but when I went to visit, I hated it. I was only there about an hour. If I hadn't visited, I probably would have gone. Sure, I had to pay for the extra airfare, but I saved money in that instead of a small private college, I'm at a large public one (and on a National Merit Scholarship, which they don't usually accept at private universities). I also go to school in my hometown, a decision I made in spite of people telling me that it was the *worst idea possible*. Actually, it's been great. I go home and do my laundry for free, occasionally my parents take me out to dinner, I've got friends in town year-round, etc. I'm not saying this is the best decision for everyone (or even, for anyone else), but make your own decision, not someone else's.\n\n**Take the SAT as early as possible** I'm serious. I think I took it once at the end of my sophomore year and once during the fall of my junior year, and my best math and  verbal scores gave me a 1510. This meant that senior year I didn't have to worry about SAT's at all (although I think I took my SAT II's my senior year?), so when other people are really stressing out that they NEED to score well on a test because it's their last chance, or whatever, you'll be sleeping late on all your Saturday mornings.\n\n**Get to know your college counselor** I was lucky in that the college counselor of my high school had known me since I was in diapers, because the better your counselor knows you, the more likely he or she is to say really positive things to admissions counselors on your behalf. Additionally, they'll make sure all your recommendations, etc., are well taken care of.\n\n**Don't trust your counselor blindly** As much as they might like you, they're still human. Do your own research about what colleges you might like, and check to make sure everything is submitted yourself. Mistakes happen.\n\nThat's all I've got for now.

Go to a university (not college) where other smart people go.  Otherwise, you'll be just as bored as you likely are in high school.  It doesn't have to be MIT, but you shouldn't think that the local university where the average ACT score is 19 is a good choice either.\n\n2.  Unfortunately, names do matter.  If you want to be an investment banker, it's really hard to get onto Wall Street with a no-name dgree.  Not that it can't be done, but the recruiters won't come to your school.  I know, I know, you're going to major in 0-Chem, but going to a school with a reasonable reputation gives you options.\n\n3.  Pick a university with lots of options.  I briefly considered GMI (formerly General Motors Institute).  It would have been fine as long as I wanted to design cars, but I would have been screwed otherwise unless I transferred.\n\n4.  Read this Paul Graham essay:\n\nhttp://www.paulgraham.com/college.html\n\n5.  Pick a school in an urban area.  Yes, it may feel gritty compared to picturesque campuses in the middle of nowhere, but you'll feel a lot more connected to reality.  While in school, I visited a very rural school for the weekend. It was a different world -- no one was talking about what internships they were going to get, and they were obsessed with the artificial world created by the university (think high school pep club).\n\n6.  I obsessed over the differences between Computer Science and Computer Engineering, and, specifically, whether choosing one over the other would have a detrimental impact on my career options.  Obviously, it didn't matter.  One of the best developers I've ever worked with has a degree in French Lit.  He moved into software after only a few month doing technical writing for a device/device driver manufacturer.  Like PG says, pick a major that gives you options.  The best employers want you because you are smart, not because of any specific skills you get.\n\n7.  With that said, don't pick a \"career\" major like nursing unless you're _really_ sure that you want to be a nurse, etc.  These majors are quite limiting without further study.  Of course, you can't be a nurse without a nursing degree, and the same is true with most of these specialty majors.\n\n8.  Live in the dorm, make close friends, and hang out a bit (or a lot).  Don't waste your time doing a lot of contrived campus activities.  If you want something else to do, find something more real world -- work with a professor on his/her research, get a \"real\" (interesting) part-time job, or find a legitimate hobby.  There are people at most universities whose job it is to contrive activities for you to participate in.  Don't buy into the idea that these things are obligatory or especially helpful in getting a job.  I'd much rather hear someone in an interview tell about how they found gigs for their band than listen to them blather about how they ran for homecoming king.\n\n9.  Hardly anyone flunks out of school because they aren't smart enough.  Yeah, some people figure out that they can't cut it as a math major, but they'll switch to something else if they're ambitious.  Why do they fail?  Lack of responsibility.  They don't go to class, spend their time on IRC, drinking way too much, or going home every weekend to visit their high school friends.  Literally, these three categories made up 90+% of the non-stupid failures I observed.\n\n10.  Don't let your parents tell you what to do.  I saw way too many kids with parents way too involved.  One girl went home for the weekend so that \"they\" could pick out a major.  Microbiology was considered bad because she \"would get some strange disease!\"  I know it's hard, especially if they're footing the bill, but it's your life, not theirs.  My wife complains weekly that she let her mother pick her major.  I think there's a PG essay on this topic as well, but I gotta go to sleep.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5yvva", "id": "c02ap2v", "author_flair_css_class": null}

If you go to college and you're not interested in what you're doing, you may do poorly and end up wasting several semesters before you get back on track.\n\nWhen you get to college, give every class you take a fair shake, even if you think it sounds like bullshit. If you have a good professor and you pay attention, you *will* get something out of a course, even if it's Underwater Basket Weaving. (That, of course, assumes you are open to new concepts. For example, you won't learn much from a religious philosophy class if you've convinced yourself that your religion (or lack of it) is the only world view worth learning about.)\n\nNext, you should look for opportunities on-campus to get a job in your field of choice. Most student jobs on campus are nothing special--food services, doing paperwork, etc.--but if you find a job doing *real work* that's related to your planned career, you'll graduate with a much better idea of what you want to do *and* a badass resume.\n\nLastly, save money. Seriously. As soon as you get a job, start socking away as much of your pay as you can. Buying toys is fun, but by the time you graduate, you'll appreciate having money set aside for a down payment on a car or living expenses while you go looking for a job.", "author_flair_css_class": null}

When you're approaching a chick for the first time, just keep it casual. So many times I found myself thinking \"oh god she's so hot, don't screw this up.\" And I'd have a vision running through my head of me and her walking on the beach at sunset. And then I would go up to her and she was boring, or just plain stupid, etc. Moral of the story: You're not proposing to her, so what's the big deal? When you're talking to a chick it's not about impressing her or making her like you, it's about assessing whether or not you are a match at some level. If she's a bitch to you, then she's a bitch, so no you're not a match...unless you like bitches.\n\nOh, and pursue academic interests outside of class. Be intellectually curious.

Glad you asked. Let's assume you're a USA male?\n\nI'm 40. Here's what I recommend and much of it I have either not done or cannot do, but feel from what I've read that I would have done so much better had I been able to do or had done.\n\nLift weights and stay thin. It's so darn easy to gain weight once you're older, and so hard to get it off. Watch what you eat. If you live in the USA, you'll get used to too much fattening food. Fattening food is okay if kept in a once-a-day thing or perhaps once every two days. When eating in a restaurant or at home, don't follow your mother's advice and eat everything on your plate -- eat only until full and scrap the rest. Eat light breakfasts and light lunches, but then splurge at dinner. Splurge on those dinners, but before you go to bed, know that you're going to have to run the treadmill, do stomach crunches and lift weights at least for an hour and a half 4 days a week. As for lifting weights, I'm sorry but women are shallow and they like well-toned men. Also, getting the right soul mate requires getting in where the competition is, and you need to have the physique that stands up to the other guys. Think Matthew McConaughey body.\n\nStudy abroad at least for one or two years. You'll have a better world view, have better stories for your future girlfriends, and may have a sweet honey to take home. I recommend Sweden, Holland, Spain, Brazil, Italy, or Australia, but not anywhere else.\n\nThe moment you can grow a goat-tee, do so and keep it trim. Watch the rest of that grotesque body hair. Women hate any other kind of body hair except, of course, in the proper place.\n\nDon't go to work for a regular company once you leave college. Work for a few startups instead, and perhaps more than one at the same time if you can swing it. You'll enjoy life a heck of a lot more.\n\nAlways have something web-based (and legal) on the side that you do for cash, regardless of whatever job you have.\n\nAvoid any job that requires you to wear a suit or even a tie. It's not worth it.\n\nRent a small house built in the 1950's rather than an apartment, trailer, or anything else. It makes the most financial sense and has a better image for dates you bring back home. And when you can finally move in a financially sound way into a house with a mortgage, start with the 50's bungalow first. Then, when you move out in a financially sound way into a better home, don't sell this old house but rent it instead for $200 more than you were paying on the mortgage.\n\nMake as much money as possible in the shortest amount of time. Great women flock to the most money. It's a fact.\n\nFind about five girlfriends who don't want to be your girlfriend, but would be willing to give you advice about what women like in men. Sometimes the best opportunity here is to ask the girlfriends of some of your friends.\n\nNever own a credit card or a debit card. Pay for everything in cash.\n\nGet a used Jeep that gets 21 mpg (they do that now, btw, if you look for the right model). In fact, never buy a new vehicle ever again. Jeeps turn chicks on, are easier to fix, and you can slightly wreck them and easily find an aftermarket part to repair what's broke. \n\nThere are really only two reasonable places to meet women these days, even abroad. They are college and fake little clerical jobs you take just to ask women out (even if that gets you fired). Remember, most businesses in the USA have the \"ask only once\" rule. And businesses that are not so corporate are ones where you may find the greatest success.\n\nNever smoke a single cigarette or take any drugs. Get into rock climbing or hiking trips with groups.\n\nFind a hobby to make yourself interesting and to be satisfied with your own self, such as playing a guitar (well!), surf, doing carpentry, or building wood boats. Model railroading, welding, car maintenance, and loud drumming are not the thing to do.\n\nInvest 15-20% of your income in a diverse range of markets such as fuels, metals, tech stocks, other stocks, bonds, and so on. Let your local credit union help you. And yes, you may want to purchase the obvious shares of stock yourself instead of getting a stock fund for all your stock purchases. A good case in point is Amazon and Google -- fantastic stocks to own. And did you know there are things like real estate funds? I heavily recommend you invest some in real estate. Instead of handling the risk of your own real estate investments, use a professional to do it for you. \n\nDo get a 401K and max it out if you can. And if your company doesn't have one, then put at least another 8% away into an IRA. And why? Because old people need more cash than they think they need and most often come up short.\n\nYou're 16. Like it's a race to save your life, have safe sex NOW! You can have the stuff we old guys can't have because we'd be arrested, darn it. Never in your life will you have this opportunity ever again. And if you need a little boost, mow a lawn for a recent hot divorcee with children and flirt with her a little -- perhaps she could help unstick what's stuck and give you extra cash as well! Ha! (I say this because now that I'm married I've had more recent hot divorcee's flirt with me than I've ever had.)\n\nDon't have sex with drunk women, or force a woman down the path of sex. You either have the opportunity fair and square, or you move on.\n\nDon't cuss. Chicks hate that except when having sex. In fact, make a statement and wince when someone else cusses -- chicks dig that too because it shows maturity.\n\nMost women in this world want men to replace their dads. And I don't mean that in a sexual way, but in an emotional nurturing way. Yet when I was 16 until 30, I had this all wrong. I was constantly seeking \"mommy\" and never finding it. Chicks don't want to be your mommy any more -- this ain't the 1950's.\n\nStay confident but not too cocky. However, witty, cocky humor, along with something that nurtures women in a mature way and shuns bad behavior of other men -- that's what women seek, young or old. However, you can also cross the line here in being too geeky or too squeaky clean, and women don't like that either. Women these days like their men a little bit bad, but not too bad. Bad as in \"I used to own a Harley,\" not bad as in, \"Want to try some crystal meth on our date?\"\n\nDon't get a motorcycle or be too reckless.\n\nStay in school until your MBA, but start with startups right before getting your Bachelor's Degree. Unfortunately many companies won't let you get into the decent paying jobs until you have your Master's, even though this is terribly stupid.\n\nAny math beyond Trig is worthless unless you plan to get into Engineering. I mostly use Algebra and ratio math (two ratios, equal to each other, solve for x) at least twice a month. Written and interpersonal communication is key. A good statistics class is very useful. Web development and a couple marketing courses are very useful too. If there's a class on entrepreneurship, take it, definitely. Most other classes are crap and worthless unless you plan to go into that field or are not certain whether you might like that field or not. Everything else you can teach yourself with a book or an Instructional DVD.\n\nA high GPA is only worthwhile if you want to go to a higher school, keep your scholarship, or get a scholarship to a higher school. Businesses don't care one bit about your GPA except if you plan to join an internship program. Well, you may find a business here or there that may not hire you if you have D's and F's, but surely not C's.\n\nCommit in your life that your commutes to the office will be short so that you have more time with your family, or push hard for telecommute at least part of your week or every other week or perhaps just a few days every other week.\n\nAs for having children, I've found that some kids are expensive, and others are not. My daughter is frugal, is satisfied with little, and doesn't beg me for lots of cash. My son is not frugal, is never satisfied, and constantly begs me for little bits of cash no matter where I go.\n\nNever get married and immediately work with your spouse to get a house together. If there's one way to rip apart a budding relationship, that's one of them.\n\nAvoid marriage up to the age of about 35 and never past 40. Younger chicks dig older guys if they're strong, look great, don't have any personal issues, don't smell, and are wealthy.\n\nNever shout at, show anger, or hurt a girlfriend or a future wife. Act like a priest and a father to women because it's far more effective than any other treatment of them. I've found with my wife, when she's locker her keys in her car for the second time in a week, that way too much kindness was more effective than any anger.\n\nSince we're wishing for anything, see if you can find a bisexual wife who wouldn't mind doing some polygyny with a second wife (not legally married, of course). Not only does it help the financial situation, it has many other advantages as well. And where do you get these women?

Don't get a credit card until you have a full time job/career, and can pay the balance off fully every month.\n\nFind a passion in life that drives you, a reason for living, OTHER THAN YOUR JOB.  Unless your job is something you perticularly  enjoy daily then go for it.  But something like a hobby helps too.  \n\nDon't fall into stereotypes, develop your own sense of style, draw ideas from many different places, use them to create YOU, your unique sense of self.  \n\nConfidence is sexy: Cockiness is not.\n\nTwo kinds of birthcontrol ALL THE TIME, unless you want to have a kid.  \n\nMarriage, kids, house - is NOT the life for everyone.  Monogomy/Marriage - is NOT the only way to have a serious/loving relationship.  \n\nYour life does not have to work a certain way, or based on anothers ideas.  Create them yourself, be safe, think out your life plans,  have longterm and short term goals, and use them to create the life that YOU want to end up with.  \n\nAlso, I STRONGLY recommend getting a gun permit as soon as your able, concealed carry even.  Learn how to use it, and use it well.   \n\nLearn basic survival skills, how to survive if the world suddenly went to shit and youre left with nothing but a knife and the clothes on your back.  \n\nPay attention to current events, politics, weather.  \n\nBe prepared in general.  Learn how to maintain your own car/computer/body.  \n\nDon't eat fast food, EVER.  Learn how to cook for yourself.\n\nWork out every other day for 20 mins.  \n\nIf you want to splurge on something, be it a car, some other large expense, save up for it, pay for it in cash, and be proud to own it, and say you OWN this, and enjoy the hell out of it.  \n\nSaving money attracts money to you, spend money, and it will never stay in your hands.  \n\nPrint ALL these comments from people out, hang them on your wall,let them become your mantra, this is some of the best advice you could ever read.  \n\nLife experience is so valuable, and I wish I could go back and do it again, knowing what I know now.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02apuo", "parent_id": "t3_5yvva", "id": "c02apuo", "author_flair_css_class": null}

A couple years later I passed them by and some found myself in a position where they were asking me for a job.  They didn't get it.

I have a few pieces of advice.\n\n1. Find clubs that you enjoy being a part of and get involved with the intent of moving up the ranks (like if for the campus newspaper, go for an editor position), it'll be a huge help when you're looking for jobs in that field after you graduate. Don't get involved in so many that you run yourself ragged, though. \n2. This may depend on what college you go to, but get in touch with alumni. I am often too shy to contact alumni about jobs because I'm afraid they'll just think I'm a selfish brat who's only interested in their life because I want to get a job. Screw that. Be courteous and thoughtful, sure, but chances are, the people you're talking to got where they are the same way you did. They'll probably even call it having a \"go getter attitude.\"\n3. Be yourself, be honest with yourself, and keep your options open. This probably will sound nonsensical, but believe it or not, when I entered college I *wanted* to remain a virgin because I thought I would find a woman   who shared my sense of values. The problem: they were all hardcore Christians, and I was strictly secular. You're going to make a compromise of some kind eventually. In my case, I decided I'd rather risk my body than my mind so I eventually decided to get laid.\n4. Make an effort to talk to people that aren't necessarily in your \"clique.\" You might be surprised who you meet. Be your own person. If you and the guys go out to a party and your friends say it's lame, don't leave just because they're leaving. Stay, dance, get drunk, and maybe get laid. \n5. Don't shun someone just because your friends have decided th have committed some horrible offense against them. Most of the time, words were taken out of context and people were blind to their own douchebaggery. It happens. You'll do it, too. Listen to people, try to forgive and forget, but don't try to be a saint or the impartial observer for everyone.\n6. This is another that probably only applies to liberal arts college, but don't be a snob. If you get introduced to indie music or something and you realize you think The Decemberists is the best band ever, remember  who you were when you loved Staind (yes, Staind). There's always way snobbier hipsters than you, and there will always be those who love what you think isn't so great. I've found that the coolest people are the ones who listen to a lot, are honest about their guilty pleasures, and are honest about their opinions of music, no matter how snobby or philistine-like their opinions make them sound. This applies to pretty much all art, film, literature, and other things of taste.   \n7. Also, be sure to wear an onion on your belt. It was the style at the time.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nedit: pontification.", "author": "falseprophet", "created_utc": "1193114245", "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_5yvva", "id": "c02aq09", "author_flair_css_class": null}

Remember that everything you're learning makes sense.  You have to figure out why it makes sense.\n\nWhich girls do or don't like you will be very stochastic.  Use this to your advantage.  If a girl makes lots of eye contact when you guys are talking (especially if she's unusually hot), she's probably at least somewhat into you.  Don't wait.  Tell her you want to talk again sometime and get her number.  To stay confident when asking if she wants to do an activity, convince yourself (and maybe her) that you want to be friends (because she's a cool person).  The friends-zone rule only applies if she thinks that she's the one pushing for just friendship.  If you're already confident, just ask her out if you've spent more than half an hour talking.  Whenever you're trying to get over a girl who dumped you, remind yourself that you really liked certain characteristics about her, and not EVERYTHING about her.  Other girls have her good characteristics too, and don't have her bad characteristics.\n\nLearn to meditate.  It takes a couple months before you start growing more dendrites related to meditation.

Good for you.\n\nAs a current undergrad, I would say this:\n\n1. When you're touring colleges, make sure you ask around informally and try to find out what the social vibe there is.  Half of college is the studying; the other half is the social life, and if if it's overly clique-ish or preppy or Greek and that's not you, you might be uncomfortable later.\n\n2. Don't choose a major (or your classes, or a future career) based on how hard the classes are or how good at them you think you are.  The classes you take in college will probably have very little to do with the realities of your job later on.  They're just something you have to get through, the same way you had to get through high school.\n\n3. If there's even the remotest possibility you might want to do anything related to science later on (and even if you think there's not -- I thought I hated science, and now I'm pre-med), fulfill your science core requirements with intro bio and chemistry, not a fluff course.  You'll regret wasting those credits later on if you change your mind.\n\n4. GO TO CLASS.  Don't let yourself get in the habit of skipping your first year, because it's easy to do, but it's a hard one to break later.  You think when you have a textbook and your teachers post their lectures online that you don't need it, but you'd be surprised how much easier it is to pass your classes when you always go.\n\n5. Don't get a credit card.  Seriously.  Everyone I know here with a credit card (including me) is in debt.  Everyone who just got a debit card is doing fine.  Credit cards are just bad news for college students.\n\n6. Don't work during the semester unless you have to.  I mean, it's one thing if you have to be able to pay rent or tuition or something, but if you're just doing it for spending money, you're better off just living poor.  Think about the investment you're making in your tuition; you owe it to yourself (and your parents, or whoever's paying) to give your studies as much of your attention as you can.\n\n7. Cut back on the TV now, and get out of the habit of watching during the week at all.  It rots your brain, shortens your attention span (making it harder to pay attention in lectures and to read and study for any serious stretch of time), and sucks up time you don't have.\n\n8. Finally, realize that college is about taking responsibility for yourself and the decisions you make for the first time in your life.  You're suddenly going to be responsible for your classes, your relationships with professors and departments, housing contracts and rent and repairs, etc.  It's awful the first time you realize you've gotten yourself into something you hate that you can't get out of -- there are no parents swooping in to rescue you; it's just you and your reputation on the line.  So think carefully about your decisions.\n\n9. Ok, I lied.  Last one.  Don't walk around alone at night.  Even if you think you're living in the campus bubble and you're safe... you're not.  Especially if you're a girl.  Carry pepper spray and take a self-defense course.  Seriously.", "author_flair_css_class": null}

Except for clearly life-threatening things, develop a habit of saying yes to new experiences.\n\n- You will never regret putting your heart and soul into something you care about.\n\n- You will always regret spending too much time on something that you didn't much care about.\n\n- Happiness is a choice. This seems completely ridiculous if you're young, because up till now you haven't been allowed to make enough of your own choices to see this. For you, happiness probably means escaping restrictions. But most long-term happiness is about being able to adjust to circumstances  and being secure in your own self-worth so that nobody can take you down. Happiness has almost nothing to do with achievement or pleasure.\n\n- But don't let that stop you from seeking achievement or pleasure. This is what the ride is all about.\n\n- Unless you're studying a truly timeless topic, most of what you know is obsolete by the time you get out. So, what to study? Learn how to learn. Learn the fundamentals of your field that don't change. Learn how to be disciplined, and learn how to relax. This is kind of maddening advice since you have to act like the content of your coursework means something, but often it won't. \n\n- By the time you're 18 or so, nobody in this society is much smarter than you. Politicians, professors, *everyone*. It's scary if you think about it -- almost everybody's kind of winging it. But there are important differences between them and you. You don't have all the facts and experience yet, and you don't have your own abilities and emotions under control yet. You can do the most about the last thing.\n\n- You cannot trust what people say about themselves. Know them by their actions.\n\n- Sexual relationships are never going to make *sense*, but you can get the hang of them.\n\n- Being physically fit really matters. If you're a geek, try to find something that you enjoy doing. I was always one of the fastest sprinters in my grade, but I shied away from sports because I believed it wasn't \"me\" and that those jocks could never accept me.\n\n- A lot of social relations are strangely recursive. People will treat you the way you act like you want to be treated.\n\n- Evil exists. Call it sociopathy if you want, but there are some messed-up dudes walking around who truly enjoy causing pain.\n\n- With a few exceptions (see above) be gentle and forgiving with people. They are prone to make mistakes and disappoint you. But almost all of them are fragile and beautiful in their own way.

That feeling of anger you have when adults are telling you they know what's best for you, and how to run your life? It's legitimate. They don't have a fucking clue, they're simply projecting their own nonsense issues onto your life. YOU are the only one who knows what is good for YOU.\n\n2. Your priorities will change MANY time throughout the course of your life. So don't worry about not knowing what you are going to do with your life. You are going to do many different things with your life. That's how it works.\n\n3. Have a lot of sex. It's pleasurable, and that's more important than anyone will actually let on. Moreover, it will help you to avoid confusing sex with love later on. Don't let anyone sell you on commitment or monogamy until you're ready for it. \n\n4. Don't have a kid by accident. When you have a kid, all your priorities are instantly superceded. Don't let that happen until and unless you are financially and psychologically prepared. \n\n5. Try drugs if you want. Most of them are less harmful than alcohol. But don't overdo it. And above all, don't smoke. Don't even try one. Those things are deadlier than crack and more addictive than heroin. (Not to mention that they make you smell worse than a wino in July.)\n\n6. Don't get a credit card. They'll be all over campus trying to sucker you in, telling you that you can \"build your credit\". Debt is slavery. Everything bought with debt costs more. Don't sell yourself. \n\n7. Be nice to people, but only those who are nice to you. Ultimately, everyone everyone's looking out for themselves. The ones you can trust are the ones whose motives are clear, and are willing to exchange what you want for what they want. Anyone who says they have your best interests at heart, and are just looking out for you, is trying to sucker you.\n\n8. Don't get involved in a religion. See #7.\n\n9. Don't hang out with losers. They will drag you down with them. (This means addicts, drama queens, people with impulse control problems, chronic failures, complainers who leech away the joy in *your* life, and so on.) You friends are supposed to make your life better, not worse. \n\n10. Don't get involved with someone just because you \"love them\". Love is what you have with who you decide to get with, not a reason for getting there. Compatibility, not love, is what makes that whole thing work. Make a list of what you want in a mate. Keep refining it. Anyone who doesn't match the list is not a keeper. Have some screaming orgasms with them, then move on. \n\n12. Above all, *don't stress*. As you get older, you will get calmer and stuff will bother you less. Most of the things you are afraid of will eventually happen to you and turn out not to be such a big deal. Those that never do were obviously a waste of time to worry about. Be happy.\n\n\n ", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c02aqd6", "parent_id": "t3_5yvva", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}

First be a doctor, lawyer, or engineer.  If that doesn't sit well with them I tell them this.  \n\nIf you have a passion for any field follow it.  But go into it knowing what the reality of that path will bring.  Do some research into it.  What you think you want to do with your life may not have the best path for doing what you really want to do with your life.  In the real worlds there are a lot of ways to get to a goal.  Understand that whatever you dream job is you won't get that strait out of school unless you are the very very best.  Most people need to work up to the job. You don't want to arrive and find out you have just spent 5-10 years killing your passion and soul and need to find a new path.\n\nHow are your grades?  Are they realistically good enough to get into the school you want to go to?  Are you talented enough to get there? Have you done enough \"character building\" activities that colleges like to see? Work on these.  If your not sure work harder and be more involved.  If you don't think you can make it even if you work hard or your grades aren't good enough, or you can't afford it don't worry.  There is no harm going to a JC first then transferring in.  You still get all the bragging rights for going to the school.  Just stay on track.  Your path is not my path.\n\nYou really don't need to know what you want to do when you start college.  But you do need to have an idea what fields you're interested in.  You want to keep restarts to a minimum but there is no shame in a six year plan if you can afford it.  But remember a lot of fields now require more than a BA/BS and you'll need to get a masters.  Which would turn that 6 year plan into an 8 year plan pretty easily.\n\nUsually you have very little chance of getting hired for the jobs that require a masters right out of college so if you can put off getting the masters straight through.  Get some real world knowledge under your belt and return for it.  Look for a good path from entry level to your goal job. And plan to go back for that masters right before you get the level of real world experience you need for the dream job.  Get the masters and get the job.  Again make sure you'll be able to deal with the tedium of the entry level jobs you'll need to have to get where you want to go.  \n\nWhatever carrier you want to go into take some time to seriously study business.  Learn how to manage and make money.     If you want to be an artist or writer or a web developer that is great but learn business. You may think that business has little to do with your goal but it has everything to do with your goal.  Learn how to manage and market yourself.  \n\nStay away from the credit cards.  Seriously stay away from them.  If you can't pay cash don't buy it.  Sure get one and use it as a buffer for your purchases but don't let debt ride.  Quick example; like a lot of people I got  a big credit card debt in college.  Couple that with my wife's and for 10 years after we were living hand to mouth.  Then we received some inheritance that aloud us to wipe out our debt and nothing else.  6 months later we had saved enough money to buy a condo in San Francisco. And we still have money after the down payment.   Stay away from credit card debt.\n\nIf you are so inclined have as much sex as you can get ( I do tell my nieces and nephews this part too).  It only gets harder to get after you graduate.  Meet a pretty girl  or handsome boy.  Get to really know them.  Repeat often.  Find new definitions of Pretty and handsome. \n\nHave fun.  Its college.   It will be the most fun, most exciting most optimistic time of your life.  Be nice make lots of friends.  Be the fun nice guy not the mean asshole.   Most people that are friends for life will be met here. So be nice to everyone make lots of friends and stick together.  When you get out of college these are the people that will help you rise up the latter or at least help you get into a good company so the more friends the better.  Your high-school friends that you hold so dear right now will be out of your life in a couple years.  You will likely see them only when visiting your parents for the holidays and school reunions.  Hard to believe but usually true.  Unless of course all of you never leave your home town.  Then you will be stuck in the life you create now, most likely.  \n\nYou should leave your home town.  Go to school at least 100 miles away from home.  If your close to your family this is far enough to still visit with out plane fare but far enough that you won't be living at home.  Don't live at home while your in college.  In fact if you leave your home town don't go back to live after you've moved.  Create you own life.  Don't return to the one that everyone know you as a dopy 14 year old boy/girl.  Go to the one where you're the cool/interesting/smart/exciting doctor/lawer/artist/teacher/web developer.    \n\nLastly,  be open to all opportunities.  You may find that what you studied isn't what you will end up doing and that is ok.  Things change.  ", "author_flair_css_class": null}

You will gain money, experience and an insight into what the real world is like.\n\nDig around for unusual majors.

I suggest you do it if it hard, painful and/or scary in the present but leads to good feelings in the future.  Likewise, avoid stuff that feels good now but leads to bad feelings later.  Exercise, education, sex, drugs, charity, etc.  If only all of these were easy to classify as healthy or not.  This approach only works if you can predict the future.  Since that's not always easy then, if all else fails, be brave.\n\nTrust your gut.  It's your second brain.  No, [really](http://www.asimplerway.com/archives/000163.html)!\n\nThere are machines and there are people. The difference is that people have a soul.  No, I'm not talking about religion here.  I'm just saying that if you grow up and join a corporation and live your life on a a strict schedule and constantly worry about how you can be a better cog in the machinery of the world then you run the risk of someone mistaking you for a machine.  Avoid that mistake.  Almost everyone else falls for it.  Hang on to your \"soul\".  And be careful about spending time with people who have lost theirs.  If you're confused what that means just look at little kids.  The younger the person, the more soul they still have.  In general.  Which is why I think it's funny you come to older people for \"advice\".  We should be looking to you.\n\nThe trouble with having a soul is that everyone else will want it.  Religions, right wing conservatives, left wing liberals...  all want you!  And each one is a great place to hang out.  They'll give you a simplified view of the world.  Which will make you feel cozy and you won't have to think too hard and each one can server as a basis for hate.  Check them out but be careful about staying in any one club for too long.  See previous advice.\n\nDon't worship people.  Einstein, Mother Theresa, \"terrorists\", etc.  They aren't so different from you.  What you see in others, good and bad, is in you.  Believe in yourself and have some compassion for all people.\n\nIn the west we're only taught to think.  Meditation is just a chance to focus on feelings.  Give it a try if you need a break.  At a minimum, reserve a little time to be alone and do nothing.\n\nStand on a street corner.  Stay there until you can see beauty in each person that drives by.\n\nThe best substitute for anger is curiosity.\n\nYou evolved from a sponge.  That is your true nature.  You only have three functions: take stuff in, digest/filter, and use the good stuff to grow yourself, reproduce and influence other sponges.  Be a good sponge.\n\nYou'll hear a lot about the importance of love.  Go for it but remember that love can make you vulnerable.  Be prepared to protect your boundaries.  For every ten books you read about love, read one about the value of war.\n\nOh, wait.  For some reason I thought you were a girl.  For boys: read one book about love for every ten about war.\n\nSharks don't just swim up and bite you in half.  They usually bump you first.  Pay attention (to what you *feel* in your *gut*), you'll only have seconds to get out of the water.\n\nDon't forget, you have value.  Whether you stand out or stay hidden.  Whether you take any of this advice or make mistakes.   Even if you don't pay your taxes.  You will always have tremendous value.\n\nFavorite quote: \"Never give up.

A lot will change over the next 10 years in your life, so the most important skill to learn in College is how to learn. you probably should have learned that by the end of High School, but there is no guarantee. Regardless of which career, interest, profession you want to pursue, you will probably want to do something different in ten years, or you will be doing something in your chosen career than where you started. Knowing how to use what you have learned and what you are going to learn to keep moving forward will give you the tools you need for success.\r\n\r\n2) Look for connections between thoughts and ideas in the various classes you take. A class may bore you to death, but you might see a connection between for example, Intro to Psychology and Computational Logic.\r\n\r\n3) Keep your mind open. Regardless of your social viewpoint or background, always try to understand another view, even if you disagree with it. If you do disagree, use the college years to develop your understanding why.\r\n \r\n4) Fight the instinct to \"play now and work later.\" Although you will make mistakes, and will probably have a good time at least once instead of studying for that exam, doing that paper, completing that project. We all did. That is OK, we learn from our mistakes. The college environment allows us to screw up royally, and correct our errors in a way that almost no other environment will allow. It is part of the education/maturation process, BUT you must learn how to balance work versus play.\r\n\r\n5) Relationships matter. Get away from the computer terminal, the video console, the text messaging and MEET people, in person. Social activities, whether you are a gamer geek, a jock, a hippie, a punk, whatever. You will need social reliationships your entire life and what you do in college will influence you heavily. The relationships you make in your college years will do more for starting your career post college than anythig else. It will mean the difference between a job and a career.\r\n\r\n6) Use the Alumni network of the college or university you go to. Alums love to help out. That's why we put our names on the alumni contact lists.\r\n\r\n7) People can be mean, and college can be scary. The social support of friends from high school and family can feel very remote. Don't be afraid to recognize this. Don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it.\r\n\r\n8) Learn how to budget your time. This is VERY hard for some people.\r\n\r\n9) Learn how to say no. This is also very hard for some people.\r\n\r\n10) The name of the college matters. Some schools will open doors for you and others will not. Colleges have reputations in areas for a reason. \r\n   ", "author_flair_css_class": null}

So go to an ivy league if you can afford it.  If you can't afford it then forget about the college name, just don't go to one that's definitely recognized as worthless. But now you'll need to worry about getting a very good education since you can't rely on the college name as much.  Research the department of these mid-tier colleges rather than the colleges, as you can have an exceptional department in a mediocre college or a mediocre department in an exceptional college.  Speak to someone about how to determine if a department is good.  Most of the \"liberal education\" that you learn in college is useless.  The idea that the purpose of college is to groom you holistically is now laughable if it was ever true at all.  If you are interested in making a living use college for vocational education, forget the classic studies or you will be poor for the rest of your life.  If you want to learn about the world, go see the world.  Your lame professor telling you what she did or read in a book is a poor alternative.  Get out of college as fast as you can.  That way you can use the time you save to travel but still enter the work world at roughly the same time as your peer group.  You will appear and be more mature and sophisticated than they in a way that can't be taught in the classroom.  This edge will be invaluable.  College and schooling in general will make you hate learning.  Don't forget that you use to do it naturally and like it once.  Most of the most useful lessons that you learn in college is by watching your fellow students succeed and fail.  Make sure that you're paying attention.  Learn how to interact socially with other human beings by watching your professors.  Do the exact opposite.  One last thing.  Don't take advice from idiots.

It will have a very low tuition cost. Most people locally in the area probably refer to it as 13th and 14th grade.\n\nThis is the place to spend your crazy time, if you feel you need it. This is also the best place to branch out and try a bazillion different subjects. Don't waste your time killing yourself trying to get into some Ivy League school right out of the gate. It's best to ease into it. Save your money for grad school and the 400+ level classes.\n\nIf you find all of your classes at said 2 year school are still easy, chances are you're a pretty smart person. If that's the case, stop messing around and take a hard subject, like engineering or advanced calculus. When you study a subject that is truly HARD even for smart people you'll start to develop a kind of rigor and thoroughness you never had to develop in the easy subjects - the kind of thing a lot of people have had since high school. It'll make things even easier for you in the future if you go back to simpler things. Who knows, you may even find you like hard subjects.\n\nTake some Math. Math has a bad rap (one of those hard subjects) - the problem is, math is not a subject, it's a language. If you expect to get into any real science at all, it's written in math. If you can't read and write math, you'll be SOL. Math is also a muscle - you need to do those ridiculous labs and dozens of problems until it becomes reflex, because later there will be something even harder that uses your new reflexes as the foundation. Get at least up into Calc II, Calc IV if you can handle it. Linear Algebra is also damn handy. Also, some people will find that calculus itself is easy, and algebra is their nemesis. Don't avoid Calc just because you hated algebra and trig. Calc is where the fun begins.\n\nAnother oft-overlooked subject is Psychology. If you want to know how people tick, that's invaluable, and Psych itself is actually a pretty easy subject. 101 will be like boot camp, but after that it's all fun and games. Get a psych of education and an organizational behavior class; if you're smart, that's really all you'll ever need to get a leg up on the game of office politics and learn how to better teach people new things. Ask around, chances are there's at least one nutty psych professor, and they generally tend to be a great bunch of people who really know how to teach.\n\nChances are there's an english professor there somewhere who has a few pet classes that are 'nonstandard' or outside the usual curriculum (bible as literature, great science fiction, etc).  Most english profs have their little pet projects and they love teaching those classes. They can be a hell of a lot of fun if you're into literature at all.\n\nIf you plan to take science like physics, take the math/calculus FIRST. Once you know basic calculus, the calc-based sciences are ridiculously easier to do than the layman versions. I can't overstate this enough. ", "author_flair_css_class": null}

We're talking about allocating space in a world far down the line enough that you'll be able to survive on some of your pevious work;  there is absolutely no sense in undoing your own work for relatively short term, small amount gain in this context.\n\nOf course keeping liquid currency isn't really a solution either, since it probably will depreciate significantly on that timescale.\n\nI don't know the answer.  I haven't got old enough to know whether I've solved it or not.   But I suspect a much better way than investing your money in pathological social institutions at random(or for greatest short term ROI), is to cultivate your local communities, so that you as a human being are a value to those around you enough that they cannot let you wither away, and to support state run retirement systems.

The hardest part of of this question is what would you *actually listen to* at 16 that you absolutely know right now would be the best habit to take on.  I for one know that if I could talk to myself at 16 I would listen to one piece of advice if it was given with strong enough emphasis.  That is to listen to, and read, only the *best* authors on a subject.  After you know their views, then you can ignore them, but not before.  Having said that you need to be reading at least 1 book per month of the *best* authors on a subject.  I'm talking Adam Smith on Economics, and then Karl Marx for the other side.  Then go contemporary with Robert Hiebroner/Keyens/Alan Greenspan's new book.  Thats an example for economics.  You should be reading the best authors for *every* major subject (business, philosophy, economics, science), then look at their bibliographies and read what they read.  That means don't read (and if you have to read, put little emphasis on) your local professors book on physics, but rather read someone like Richard Feynman.  Don't be afraid of audios and physical books.   Lastly, none of this has anything to do with your college education.  Your college education is a signal of private information to an employer to get a job.  You can have other signals, like being good friends with overachievers in a field (aka having a network) and getting jobs through them.

If you're inclined towards Spanish - I highly recommend Venezuela or Argentina for the hot women.\n\n2) If you can't do 1) - definitely enroll in a study abroad program during college.\n\n3) Travel overseas for 3 months before starting college - \na) If your budget is &gt;$10K, go through Western Europe\nb) If between $5K and $10K go to Eastern Europe, Turkey, Greece\nc) If under $5K go to Central America, South-East Asia.\n\n4) Work for a small firm (less than 100 employees) during college (or immediately after) - you will learn a lot about all aspects of business.\n\n5) Learn to dance, juggle, and/or play a musical instrument(esp. guitar, harmonica). You will be a hit wherever you are in the world.\n\n6) Try out a lot of social clubs then pick 1 or 2 and continue your involvement with them all through college.\n\nA few years out of college:\n1) Volunteer/Live in a developing country - you will learn to appreciate life. You will realize that having an American passport is like holding a winning lotter ticket, and you will go through life complaining less.\n\n2) Live in a developed country outside the US - Germany, Japan, Scandinavia, Singapore, Hong Kong. You will realize that the American way of doing things is not the only way to get rich.\n\n3) Try out different types of work before you settle. Find work that makes your soul sing - this should be a top goal for you to pursue.\n\nLive beneath your means. I think it is okay to go into debt to travel overseas at your age.\n\nOverall:\nFollow your passions, and bring a sense of curiosity, joy and wonder to whatever you do. Life is too short to do things half-assed in a pissy mood.\n\nHave a great and happy life!\n\n", "author_flair_css_class": null}

This isn't just my disgruntled view either. The majority of cadets hate being cadets. Of course, for people that never went to military college, they will think those that graduated from one are somehow special or more responsible. This too is not the case.

Sure, I learned a lot during my time, but not because my school taught it to me. I wonder if I would have come to the same realizations WITHOUT paying over 100k.

This may turn out lucrative for you in the future, but often means you'll have high debt and know few people in the area of town you want to work in.\n\nBig state schools are the exact opposite. If you get one that's ranked high enough, you get all the benefits of the elite school, yet you'll have contacts in the area of the school afterwards and can always find a job or start a business very easily there. (Try to find one in an urban area, not in the boondocks).\n\nLearn how to cultivate a buzz. Drinking a lot isn't any more fun than drinking 3-4 drinks. It just makes you do really stupid things and feel crappy the next day. And gain weight. Drink a little, wait 30 minutes for the buzz to hit, then enjoy it.\n\nLearn to do stupid things total sober. Such as introduce yourself to a stranger and make an ass out of yourself. Its much easier when sober, and more of a character builders.\n\nThe first time you fall in love, it will feel better than cocaine. Just because you want to spend every waking hour with them, don't. Keep your life balanced and you'll be happier. Always cultivate friendships *and* more than friendships. Learn to push your significant others to do the same.\n\nDump the person you were dating in high school when you go to college unless you're going to the same college. In that case, still really think about doing it. I say this because you're going to change drastically for the better in college, and if you try to hold onto the person you dated in high school, you're going to retard that growth for the both of you.\n\nHave lots of condoms, even if you're not going to use them. They may save you or your friends life. Let it be known you have them, and that you'll give them to people who need them. You can get them for free from the health center at most schools.\n\nLeave TV behind. Seriously, you don't need to watch anything beyond the occasional sports game, and you probably should be road tripping to see that live. You have all the time in the world to watch TV after school is done with. If you must, use downloadable TV and tivos, and make it an event with friends.\n\nLearn to say no to mom and dad. It is important you cut ties with them and they transform from stewards and guardians to friends and guides.\n\nWork a lot in any field you might want to do. Most things aren't like they seem from the outside. Do this as much as you can, in as many different areas that you can.\n\nLearn to speak correctly in the english you hear on the news. Learn to drop colloquialisms such as \"like\", \"for real\", \"dude\", \"homes\", etc. I don't care if you're black, a southern white, samoan, or south asian, talk like Katie Couric and Dan Rather to everyone. Make it second nature. Then you will be a candidate for everyone for near everything.\n\nRoad trip road trip road trip.\n\nIf you're not going to be an engineer, doctor, dentist, attorney, or accountant, do not take on debt. All other careers start with a low starting salary that is about 60% of what it sounds like after taxes, insurance and clothing.  A modicum of school loans may be a necessary evil, but you really really should graduate with less than 25k in debt. If you're not going to, pick a different school.\n\nStay up late talking.
