Kestrella, I know better than to think that you'd ever agree with the freerepublic crowd.\n\nSo why now? I mean, if those douchebags think Paul is horrible, isn't that to his credit? I mean really, he's the only republican they absolutely hate. They may not like one or another because they perceive that candidates enthusiasm for Iraq is not quite fanatical enough, but the only republican they dislike as much as the democrats is Paul.\n\nFrom the linked article:\n\n&gt; The US government goes bankrupt in the first year of the Paul Presidency.Social Security and Medicare benefits cease to be provided. Many of the old and disabled are forced to steal to survive. However, with the Paul Presidency endorsing the right of property owners to kill on sight such plunderers, hundreds of such people are killed each day.\n\n&gt;Meanwhile, the military cannot be funded. There is no money for logistics -- much less for member benefits. The Congress is forced to enact conscripted service legislation which Ron Paul signs (perhaps he realizes a veto will be overridden anyway). However, these conscripted members are given almost no pay or benefits and are working as virtual slaves. Military moral is at a horrific low, of course, and corruption, chaos, and desertion being the rule in the military. There is no ability of the military to accomplish its only duty under a Paul Presidency -- serve as border guards. \n\nI thought we went bankrupt years ago. But the rest is an absolute laugh riot... supposedly all of this happens because he reduces yearly revenue by a third? If we're that close to this catastrophe already, we might as well give up now. And they act like FICA is already rolled into the income tax. Christ on a stick.\n\n&gt;Meanwhile, Islamic militantism is emboldened. They step up attacks around the world. In the second year of the Paul Presidency, they sneak suitcase nukes into New York and Washington DC and detonate them. Hundreds of thousands of lives are lost with untold others critically injured. The hospitals have already been overrun with the Paul Presidency destitute seeking benefits, and have no way to deal with the injured. An already severely crippled country descends into complete chaos. A Ron Paul goal has been accomplished. There is effectively no federal government.\n\nUm, if this isn't hysterical. There are only 3 militaries ever sophisticated enough to have made such nukes. We're one, the USSR was another, China is a third. When you're on the learning curve for nukes, neither Iran nor North Korea is where you're at that you can miniaturize the things.\n\nDon't tell me you believe this part of it, Kestrella.
