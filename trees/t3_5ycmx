He's got other holdings there as well, actually.\n\n\nA few key features of that article: It is not from a \"university study\" as you say, it is from the *personal opinion* of the head of Flinder's American studies department.  \nMoreover, the way the article is written casts suspicion on whether or not it represents his actual opinion. These are the **only** direct quotes from the professor in question:  \n\u201csounded like\u201d   \n\u201cI would not put any credibility on those results,\u201d  \n\u201cI find it terrifically surprising and unlikely.\u201d to which the parentheses in the second portion of that quote (that Senator Paul would attract that level of response) indicate that it was *added*.\n\nThese are common tactics of reporters when they have a point of view they want to push, and can quote tiny snippets from an interview and paraphrase/interpret the rest to make it sound like the person they've chosen for their authority on the matter agrees with them more than they actually do.\n\nFor instance, \u201cI would not put any credibility on those results,\u201d is more than likely referring to the online polls. Which, in all honesty, are unscientific polls, likely not representing a balanced portion of the American public. To say they were hacked or astroturfed, though, is just silly. It's just that Ron Paul supporters get online and go \"omg, poll! vote Ron Paul!\" en masse, due to their relatively high familiarity with the internet compared to other candidate's followings. Baby boomer's are still the primary political force in this nation, and it's pretty safe to say that few of them would be comfortable with the change that Paul represents.\n\nAlso, even if that *was* a correct representation of the professor's view, I doubt the scope of his credentials encompass expertise in the psychology of internet memes, which it is probably safe to say Ron Paul has become. \n\nEdit: And if you're not inclined to believe Wikipedia, you can go [directly to News Corp's website](http://www.newscorp.com/index.html), and see they hold [significantly more newspapers in austrailia](http://www.newscorp.com/operations/newspapers.html) than anywhere else in the world.
