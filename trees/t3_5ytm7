Yet the regime continues to do so and continues to practice delay and deception in an obvious attempt to buy time.\" \n\nBut was it not previously agreed (about two weeks ago) that the UN Security Council was going to prepare \"a text for a third UN Security Council sanctions resolution\" but would delay imposing any sanctions on Iran until November when reports from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) were to be presented to the Council? [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7018672.stm]\n\nSo where is the delay Mr. Cheney? The leaders of Iran have given valid reasons for the nation's use of uranium and its desire to research alternative energy sources, and while the international community MUST remain skeptical of Iran's actual intentions, some compromises were made to handle the situation in a diplomatic manner and those really should be honored. So again, investigations/reports by the IAEA should be underway and last time I checked it was still October, so either I have things all wrong or Mr. Cheney is stirring up something bigger than he is letting on... and hopefully not pushing anything related to President Bush's comment  about how WWIII will be avoided only by ensuring that Iran does not have the knowledge to produce nuclear weapons.\n\nHopefully not, but if so, would mean that Iran shouldn't be able to research nuclear energy because the knowledge needed to create the energy is the same to build the weapons? And furthermore, since the Bush Administration seems to only want the US and/or its allies to be the only ones with the knowledge to produce nuclear weapons is it also trying to dictate who will be able to  produce nuclear energy? .... Seems a little fishy to me but hopefully Cheney and Bush can hold their guns while investigations are completed and the rest of us can have a chance to think", "author": "i_digress", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c02aizg", "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": "t3_5ytm7", "name": "t1_c02aizg", "author_flair_css_class": null}
