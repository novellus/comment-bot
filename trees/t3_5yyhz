Without greed, there is no motivation to work hard to create a better life for yourself, therefore, the economy stagnates. It is the reason socialist and communist countries do so poorly compared to capitalist countries and the main reason for the collapse of the USSR. I suppose in a perfect world, an absence of greed would be ideal, but it is not a perfect world and people will always be motivated by having a bigger house, better food, better cars ect...  Take away that possibility and people do what they must to survive and no more since there is no additional reward for doing more.
