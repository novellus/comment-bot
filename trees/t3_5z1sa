I've only met one person that can sustain a 80-90 wpm rate like me, but she does it in qwerty.\n\nI'm on the computer programming or writing all day and my hands never hurt.\n\nHaving your keyboard in Dvorak means nobody will ever want to use your computer or type anything.\n\nSwitching back to qwerty only takes a few keystrokes, but when I type in it now, I make a lot of mistakes and feel very uncomfortable--and like my hands are dancing a very crazy dance across the keyboard. In fact, as I type just *this* paragraph in qwerty, it's amazing how little rhythm the is between hands. Dvorak is like typing in iambic pentameter.\n\nThe Ctrl-X, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V thing *is* a big deal. On the Mac, there is a Dvorak keycaps/Qwerty modifier alternate layout that I would recommend for new learners, but my muscle memory probably wouldn't do well with the switch. I'm used to taking my hand off the mouse and hitting the qwerty 'I' key for  paste or the  qwerty '.' for V. I do a one-handed Ctrl-B (cut) with my thumb for the modifier and my forefinger for the B.\n \nThe type of typos you make are much different than those in qwerty, so people will think you are an idiot if you make too many.\n\nHere's a [tool](http://www.siteuri.ro/dvorak/index.php) that compares stats from a sample text across various layouts.", "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": "1193263092", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 3, "parent_id": "t3_5z1sa", "id": "c02b4n6", "author_flair_css_class": null}
