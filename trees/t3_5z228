Call me cold-hearted, call me whatever, but don't call me impractical. I'm going to say something dangerous.\n\nEven if it could be proven that the availability of guns contributes to school shootings and murders (which it hasn't), I believe that having a few thousand firearm murders a year in the US is worth it. Having a few dozen children die in school shootings in the US is worth it. You can't scare me into restricting firearms with save-the-children-from-being-murdered arguments. The number of civilians murdered by other citizens absolutely pales in comparison to the numbers that governments put up on the wall. One hundred seventy-four million disarmed civilians have been killed by governments in the last century. 174,000,000. That doesn't include soldiers or non-combatant deaths or \"collateral damage\" in wars. That is disarmed men, women, and kids being gassed, chopped up, or shot in the back of the head MOSTLY BY THEIR OWN COUNTRYMEN.\n\nhttp://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/20TH.HTM\n\nIn the same tiume period, there have been 10 million homicides.\n\nBy any metric you choose, the incidence of democide (killed by your government) is ten to twenty times greater than that of homicide.\n\nSchool shootings? Gangland shootings? Big deal. Find something else to scare me with, that boogeyman doesn't work no more. Even if you could prove that disarming the civilian populace 100% could absolutely prevent every single one of those deaths, it's not worth it.
