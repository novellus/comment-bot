So if you are a mythical 1 karma guy and you have huge comment fan base, it's more than likely you couldn't avoid having submission karma if you submitted anything at all. Therefore to keep yourself at 1 karma you have to be actively denying your information sources to the rest of the community.\n\nAs for Ron Paul stuff...\n\nYeah some republicans might not like Ron Paul, and this means what exactly? I am not a Ron Paul fan, but at least he gets some traction on reddit. The top 3 2008 republicans get bubkus, because they have nothing to offer. And don't even get me started on the empty fantasy that was Fred Thompson. \n\n&gt;Just submitting mindless fluff is? Talk about the TV generation in a nutshell.\n\nSo I don't even remotely understand your conclusion. Reddit is an information market Stuff you don't like is mindless fluff I guess. \n\nCase in point. The action alert to block the Senate Dem FISA bill, that generated calls and donations to Chris Dodd and helped convince him to take a stand against his own party is fluff? I don't know about you but that's what most people call effective political involvement.
