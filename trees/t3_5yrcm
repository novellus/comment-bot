See glomek's comment for a hint on the actual explanation. The decimal expansion 0.999... really means the real number which is the limit of the sequence (0,0.9,0.99,0.999,...), which is indeed 1, as can be shown using a fairly simple epsilon-N proof.\n\nThe real numbers, as typically defined, do not have infinitesimals. For any real number x &gt; 0, there is some natural number n such that 1/n &lt; x. This can be shown using an elementary property of the reals called the least upper bound property, which, due to the failings of the education system, is a detail left out of most if not all high-school programs (along with a proper definition of the real numbers, it seems).\n\nIf you want infinitesimals and infinities, the reals are not the numbers you're looking for. Something like the hyperreals would work better if you want to talk about infinitesimals, but they don't really have decimal expansions (at least in any usual sense).\n\nI also really dislike the article's style of calling everything a \"fact\". Mathematics doesn't have \"facts\", it has axioms, definitions, and theorems. The real reason that 0.999... = 1 is because we've set up the definitions in such a way that it happens to be.", "author": "cgibbard", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c02admr", "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02abpu", "name": "t1_c02admr", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "ups": -5, "name": "t1_c02abpu", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5yrcm", "retrieved_on": 1427425912, "score_hidden": false, "body": " This guy obviously failed math.

That's like saying a nickel is not a nickel. 1 is an absolute number, adding .0000's to it does not change its value at all, which is not the case with .99999 to infinity. Each number after the decimal changes the exact value, adding infinite 0's do not. 1=1.0000~to infinity, whereas .99999 does not = .99999~to infinity.   He also tries to make the point that 1.0000...-0.9999... is 0. False again. It is an infinitely small number but it is not zero.
