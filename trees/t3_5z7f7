The argument always seems to me to boil down to \"We don't understand consciousness, and we don't understand quantum measurement, therefore they must be related.\" And that just doesn't make any sense at all.\r\n\r\nI read that book, well, the parts pertaining to the nature of consciousness anyway. In my opinion Penrose thinks too highly of consciousness. He's trying so hard to believe that human consciousness is special (soul-like) that he seriously suggests that entire nerve cells are in superposition in the brain. He's great at math and all, but he just can't seem to get over belief in ghosts.", "author": "anescient", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "archived": true, "subreddit": "science", "name": "t1_c02bjva", "parent_id": "t3_5z7f7", "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02bjva"}
