While certain companies have sold certain blocks of water rights back to the people who use the Colorado River supply, this is just a small drop in a very large bucket of water draw down.\n\nThe Colorado River no longer reaches the ocean. We use ALL of it. California uses most of it and that amount cannot be changed at all, due to poorly thought out contracts.\n\nWe've already had one civil war in the region over water rights. I'd expect to see many more unless California gets serious about salt-water desalination.\n\nIn short, privitazation is not the cause of the water problems in CA. ALL of those projects came from Big Government.
