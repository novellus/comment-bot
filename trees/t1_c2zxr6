Otherwise; what's the point in playing it so long? That said, however, it's frustrating for someone to pop in and start off, because it's hard to get practice in if you're killed immediately. \n\nFrom my own experience, the best multiplay PC FPS games as far as a steady learning curve have been the larger-scale ones like Good ol' tribes and the battlefield games.  \nSmall scale though, I think so far, TF2 does a relatively good job of making itself more accessible. This is in part due to the roles of the different classes determining the style and complexity of game play, and because the artistic direction is very functional in telling the characters apart, and from a first glance, what they might be like. Even on your first round, if you're a scout, and you see a heavy, you *know* to take cover.  \nBasically though, the discussion on multiplayer accessibility  as it pertains to halo revolved around whether inferior controls make for a valid equalizing factor.
