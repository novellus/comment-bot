This is not some conspiracy, but results from the inherent nature of television and the media. You see, unless there is conflict (emotional or physical), there is no drama and all you have on the screen is a \"talking head\", which most producers feel is boring. Love and mercy, which reside in people's hearts, cannot be shown on TV, except extrinsically. Here the centripetal forces of peace are always at a disadvantage to the corrosive images of strife. What is required is a way around this impasse.\"\r\n\r\nH.R.H.
