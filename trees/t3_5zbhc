It was easy to go to and half or a third the price of, say, Berlitz.  It allowed for people not too serious to languish for years on end, but for those who wanted to learn it was excellent.  \n\nThe old timers working at the schoold were pulling down $40,000 or more a year for about 5.5 hours 'work' a day.  Newbies made about $30,000.  Tax rates and health care costs are minimal.  Nation and local about 10%.  Private health about $70 a month.  Saving money was quiet easy and one could see most of East Asia after only a few years.\n\nThe Nova haters either had terrible co-workers or a chip on their shoulder.  Since most workers were straight from college, they had unreasonable expectations. \n\nHowever, the collapse of the company had to do mostly with how it was run by the president.  Look under the hood of any English 'school' in Japan, Korea, or China and you'll find a lot of crookedness.  \n\nThe main reason Nova is so hated is their business model cut salaries.  They could provide a service for a lower price.  Other companies are much worse (Gaba and Shane).\n\nIf the locals want natives from another country to come and provide a service, then there will be a premium if foreigners don't naturally want to go.  East Asian countries are not the most enjoyable places to live (pollution, high costs, xenophobia).  \n\nIn my experience, there will be demand for naive English speakers in E.Asia for generations to come.  The ruling class purposely keep public education poor to prevent the lower classes from gaining communicative skills.  Nova actually helped a lot of people move up in society.\n\nOf course, there are those who have now been screwed.
