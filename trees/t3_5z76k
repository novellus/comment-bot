I think his vision was fundamentally misguided, however; as he saw the evolution of software in terms of vendors offering proprietary, binary-only \"software ICs\", and completely failed to account for the growth and importance of free (open source) software.\n\nAs if to confirm he's gone over totally to the dark side, these days he's implementing DRM for music companies.", "subreddit_id": "t5_2fwo", "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": "t3_5z76k", "ups": 3, "author_flair_css_class": null}

Contrast this to software. The software industrial revolution is subject to market testing. If it doesn't compete strongly by offering consumers cheaper software, it is hard to see in what sense it could be correct.\n\n&gt; The same inexorable pressure is happening today as the cost of hardware plummets and demand for software exceeds our ability to supply it. As irresistible force meets immovable object, we experience the pressure as the software crisis: the awareness that software is too costly and of insufficient quality, and its development nearly impossible to manage.\n\nWhat are irresistible forces and immovable objects doing in this essay?\n\n&gt; The software industrial revolution, like all revolutions, is as much cultural as technological. \n\nSaying that \"The software industrial revolution is as much cultural as technological.\" moves the article along, but what is the sweeping generalisation doing in there? Was the Maoist Cultural Revolution as much cultural as technological?\n\nI'm going to have to re-read my own essays on my website to check that they don't contain three-word asides like that, because they really damage an article.\n\n\n\n\n", "author_flair_css_class": null}
