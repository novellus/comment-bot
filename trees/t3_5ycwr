Out of curiosity, I asked him if there was any class of criminal that the inmates didn't like. Were murderers shunned, for instance? I was surprised when he told me the code. \"It doesn't matter what you did, as long as you don't hurt a kid.\" He told me that, according to a criminal ethic, even a murderer might be justified in killing. Even killers can have kids, however. Those inmates who have kids often invest an inordinate amount of emotional weight in their relationship with them. Murderers, muggers and petty theives all get very upset at the idea of some jerk messing with their own kids while locked away and unable to intervene. They will therefore tend to exorcise these fears by wailing on the first child-hurter they can find \"inside\". This is why all of the child molestors and kid killers go directly into \"Punk City\" (Protective Custody). This is where all those nasty types show up, along with those inmates who have been caught ratting someone out. Here, they are kept in a cell for 23 hours per day, with only the single hour for a shower and exercise. Separated from the main population, the \"punk\" inmate sees only his peers, the scum of the earth. This is the future awaiting the waste of flesh this article was written about. I forget his name already, as will the rest of the world. I can't imagine a worse punishment, or more well deserved.
