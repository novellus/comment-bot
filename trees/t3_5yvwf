Why is this in the politics sub-reddit?\n\n2. I've used XP, Gutsy Gibbon, and Vista. Of the three, I'd rank XP first, then Ubuntu a close second, and finally Vista a distant third. More of my Lenovo X61 tablet features worked on Ubuntu 7.10 \"out of the box\" (including the Wacom pen and the touchscreen) then any previous version of Ubuntu or other distribution of Linux that I've tried, but there was still a great deal of driver tweaking and configuration file editing that I had to do to get some essential components (like the WiFi) usable. \"Just Works\" is admittedly more true of 7.10 than ever before, it's just that it's still about as truthful as \"We Don't Torture\". That said, I like 7.10 a lot, and if I can get OneNote working on WINE, then I might actually consider migrating over entirely.\n\nVista is the Edsel of OSes. I actually downgraded to XP a few weeks after I purchased my laptop and have never regretted it. ", "author_flair_css_class": null}
