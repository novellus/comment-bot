One of those 2003 stories was this one:\n\n&gt; Aficionados of the Drudge Report may have noticed several striking headlines recently linking to stories from the World Tribune, an enterprise with a title as grand and ambitious as it is unfamiliar. One such story last week began, \u201cU.S. intelligence suspects Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction have finally been located.\u201d The apparent scoop\u2014of stop-the-presses significance\u2014was unsigned, and billed as a \u201cspecial to World Tribune.com.\u201d The Times, the Journal, and the Washington Post, meanwhile, not only got beat but failed even to acknowledge the news in the days that followed. What gives?\n&gt;\n&gt; Not everyone ignored it: Rush Limbaugh, for instance. \u201cThere\u2019s a piece in the World Tribune today\u2014one of the papers in the United Kingdom\u2014exactly as theorized on this program early on,\u201d he said on his radio show. \u201cIt\u2019s unconfirmed, but it\u2019s a story that many of the weapons of mass destruction are at present buried in the Bekaa Valley of Lebanon.\u201d Fox News, catering to a similar demographic, enlisted a military analyst that evening to discuss potential ramifications\u2014military intervention in Lebanon?\u2014on \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor.\u201d According to the story, the weapons were probably delivered to the Bekaa Valley, a Hezbollah stronghold, in a caravan of tractor-trailers that was spotted leaving Iraq in January, two months before the war began, as part of a multimillion- dollar storage deal between Saddam Hussein and the Syrian government. \n\nThe World Tribune is a one person outfit:\n\n&gt; In fact, the World Tribune is not published in the United Kingdom, nor is it, to be precise, a newspaper. It is a Web site produced, more or less as a hobby, in Falls Church, Virginia, and is dedicated to the notion, as its mission statement explains, that \u201cthere is a market for news of the world and not just news of the weird.\u201d (Nonetheless, the site includes a prominent feature, Cosmic Tribune, with an extraterrestrial focus, and it links to a Mafia journal called Gang Land News.) Its editor and publisher, Robert Morton, is an assistant managing editor at the Washington Times and a former \u201ccorporate editor\u201d for News World Communications, the Times\u2019 owner and the publishing arm of the Unification Church, led by the Reverend Sun Myung Moon. (Morton and his wife, Choon Boon, are themselves followers of the Reverend Moon.) Among the World Tribune\u2019s other recent half-ignored scoops are that Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for last month\u2019s blackout and that a North Korean defector stressed, during a meeting in July with White House officials, the need for a pre\u00ebmptive military strike against Kim Jong Il.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "politics", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 2, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5yvde", "retrieved_on": 1427425771, "id": "c02amj5", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02amj5", "parent_id": "t1_c02amh1", "body": "it's a main link on Drudge though. regardless of the truth value of the story, and as sad as this may be, if it's on Drudge, it's news.  and will likely appear on CNN tonight, true or not.
