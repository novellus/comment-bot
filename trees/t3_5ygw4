Why should those of us who learned programming with these editors have to go back and learn emacs? Lisp is, theoretically, pure lambda mathematics. So it shouldn't matter which editor you use. It seems to me that the only way mainstream developers will take up Lisp is if it integrates into the tools they already use. So basically, there is simply no justification for urging newcomers to learn emacs when plug-ins like this are available.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c029mtu", "id": "c029n2e", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "programming", "ups": 7, "name": "t1_c029mtu", "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5ygw4", "retrieved_on": 1427426235, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c029mtu", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5ygw4", "body": "If you want to learn lisp, especially Common Lisp, start using emacs.
