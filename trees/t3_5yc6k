Economists tend to distinguish between demand and supply and the decline of production of minerals might be seen as the result of cheaper or safer substitutes entering the market, that is to a reduction of the demand. It would be tempting to attribute the decline in production of mercury to this factor. Mercury is a toxic metal which has been substituted with various other materials and devices and it is now slowly disappearing from the market. But most of the legislation forbidding the use of mercury came much later than the mercury peak (1962) and, as we saw, mercury peaked almost exactly at the \u201cmidpoint\u201d of the available reserves, as predicted by the standard Hubbert model. A similar case, reduction in the demand, can be made for the peaking of lead, another poisonous metal. But for many applications, for instance car batteries, no substitute has been found so far for lead. Moreover, also in this case peaking took place almost exactly at midpoint of the estimated resources.", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "science", "name": "t1_c029cfg", "parent_id": "t1_c029b53", "ups": 1, "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 4, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5yc6k", "retrieved_on": 1427426387, "body": "A few of those look pretty silly to me.
