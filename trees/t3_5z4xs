This is becoming the hottest area these days.\n\nThe reason these tools are needed, is that web browsers are **not** exactly compatible with each other. You can't write an AJAX app and have it run perfectly in IE, FF, Opera, Safari, etc. It is tricky.\n\nNow, Mozilla Firefox currently runs the same way on all the major operating systems. So it could be a cross-platform app environment as well, if you think about it: Develop once for Firefox, and all people need to run your software is to use Firefox (which is a free download). But that is the problem - some people prefer IE, Opera, etc. You can't force them to switch web browser.\n\nTherefore, the solution for Mozilla is to separate web apps from the browser. That is, the platform will be Firefox, but people won't even notice it; Firefox will be like Flash. Imagine running IE and clicking on a web app, which then opens in a new window. It could be Flash, AJAX, or Firefox; you wouldn't know.\n\nSo, as I see it, separating the apps from running inside a normal instance of Firefox has a lot of potential. The immediate benefit is the lack of outer browser border - it will look like a native app, as you said. But more importantly, this will allow Firefox to become a cross-platform environment.\n", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "programming", "name": "t1_c02bds6", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 16, "link_id": "t3_5z4xs", "retrieved_on": 1427425347, "body": "As I understand it, it can't run anything that couldn't run in a browser. \nSo what functionality do I gain? \nJust the lack of the outer browser border?", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5z4xs", "id": "c02bds6", "author_flair_css_class": null}

I run amd64 Ubuntu 7.10 (upgraded from 7.04) on an Athlon X2 3800+, and have been 64-bit since June or so.  Problems so far:\n\n* Most firefox plugins (adblock plus, greasemonkey, firebug, etc) work, but there is no native flash for 64-bit Linux.  There is a workaround (a plugin hack that lets you use the normal 32-bit files from Adobe), but it doesn't seem to work as well with 7.10.  I haven't investigated it in detail -- there could be a simple fix for this.  (Unfortunately, most flash ads display just fine.)\n* No sun java plugin for firefox.  There are 32-bit and 64-bit JRE/JDKs for Java 5 and Java 6, but the 64-bit Java 6 packages don't seem to ship with a plugin for firefox.\n* A few apps aren't 64-bit clean, like [scheme48](http://www.s48.org/) or [opendylan](http://www.opendylan.org/).  There is a [workaround](http://www.opendylan.org/pipermail/gd-hackers/2007-July/005832.html) for opendylan.

I believe you can build Google Gears for amd64 systems by checking it out of svn and building it manually, but I haven't tried that.  Google Toolbar installs, and appears to run, but there are a few odd errors in firefox's error console.\n\nid games run fine -- I've had no trouble running Quake2, Quake 4, ET:QW, RTCW, etc.  Second Life works without a hitch.\n\nFirefox tends to allocate a lot more ram -- it's not unusual for me to have 600-800MB allocated (virt, not res).

I read the article and linked blogs and here's what I think are the main issues:\n\n1. Seriously long load time: I have a powerful PC (dual quad-core, 4gb ram, XP x64, scsi raid) and this thing took over 10s just to launch. Closing and opening again didn't help speed things up. Loading the website was same speed as new tab in Firefox2.\n\n2. Once you've created a \"webapp\", there seems to be no way to edit the settings other than editing the webapp.ini in C:\\Documents and Settings\\[username]\\Application Data\\Prism\\Profiles\\[weird-chars].default\\webapps\\example.com@prism.app\n\n3. Needs some desktop features to make it more useful than a new tab in Firefox: minimize to tray, true full screen, always stay-on-top option, borderless/no-titlebar mode, transparency option. These options are pretty easy to do in Windows (like I did here in [glass2k](http://chime.tv/products/glass2k.shtml) long ago).\n\n4. Would be great if you could right-click on the shortcut of the webapp and edit its settings in a new tab under Properties.\n\n5. Needs keyboard shortcut keys. If they are present, I can't find them. Keyboard for full screen, minimize to tray, stay on top etc. would be great.\n\n6. It does remember windows position like a good Windows app. However, if it's maximized on monitor 2, it reopens in monitor 1.\n\nSince my site is all Flash, I haven't tested any DOM/HTML operations. I'm guessing since it's Gecko engine, it would work well. If these guys are serious about making this thing be a good alternative to Apollo/AIR, they definitely need to make it much more easier to make and install widgets and tools.\n\nThe installation was smooth and I'd much rather use a Gecko engine than AIR/Apollo for desktop webapps.
