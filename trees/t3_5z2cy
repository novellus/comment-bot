If we adopt the attitude of the complete sceptic, placing ourselves wholly outside all knowledge, and asking, from this outside position, to be compelled to return within the circle of knowledge, we are demanding what is impossible, and our scepticism can never be refuted. For all refutation must begin with some piece of knowledge which the disputants share; from blank doubt, no argument can begin. Hence the criticism of knowledge which philosophy employs must not be of this destructive kind, if any result is to be achieved. Against this absolute scepticism, no logical argument can be advanced. But it is not difficult to see that scepticism of this kind is unreasonable. Descartes' 'methodical doubt', with which modern philosophy began, is not of this kind, but is rather the kind of criticism which we are asserting to be the essence of philosophy. His 'methodical doubt' consisted in doubting whatever seemed doubtful; in pausing, with each apparent piece of knowledge, to ask himself whether, on reflection, he could feel certain that he really knew it. This is the kind of criticism which constitutes philosophy.\n\nHere's the [full book](http://www.ditext.com/russell/russell.html).", "id": "c02b82q", "author": "tayssir", "created_utc": "1193313378", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c02b82q", "parent_id": "t1_c02b7qw", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_6", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 10, "author": "fionbio", "created_utc": "1193316511", "children": [{"subreddit": "reddit.com", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 5, "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": "1193322664", "children": [{"controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "archived": true, "ups": 6, "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5z2cy", "retrieved_on": 1427425407, "score": 6, "id": "c02b96h", "author": "fuglybear", "created_utc": "1193323788", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "body": "You're out of your fucking element, iwdw!", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c02b96h", "parent_id": "t1_c02b91f", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c02b91f", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 5, "link_id": "t3_5z2cy", "retrieved_on": 1427425409, "body": "Say what you want about the tenents of National Socialism, at least it's an ethos.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02b8al", "id": "c02b91f", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1427425405, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "created_utc": "1193324881", "ups": 1, "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5z2cy", "downs": 0, "score": 1, "body": "They're fucking cowards.", "id": "c02b9bq", "author": "diamond", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "archived": true, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "name": "t1_c02b9bq", "parent_id": "t1_c02b8al", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "name": "t1_c02b8al", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 10, "link_id": "t3_5z2cy", "retrieved_on": 1427425418, "body": "[Yes, it's possible.](http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Nihilism)", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02b7qw", "id": "c02b8al", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "created_utc": "1193336369", "name": "t1_c02bay8", "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5z2cy", "retrieved_on": 1427425385, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "body": " Some even advocate living without belief: [The problems with beliefs](http://www.nobeliefs.com/beliefs.htm) \n\nI like this essay, but I'm not entirely convinced it isn't just playing word games.", "author": "thedward", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_c02b7qw", "id": "c02bay8", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c02b7qw", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 1, "link_id": "t3_5z2cy", "retrieved_on": 1427425426, "body": "can someone believe in nothing?", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02b7lq", "id": "c02b7qw", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_6", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": -2, "author": "Kenser", "created_utc": "1193306873", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_6", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 5, "author": "bicycle_repair_man", "created_utc": "1193307393", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_6", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 3, "author": "Kenser", "created_utc": "1193313363", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_6", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 3, "author": "bicycle_repair_man", "created_utc": "1193313858", "children": [{"subreddit": "reddit.com", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 3, "author": "Kenser", "created_utc": "1193315035", "children": [{"subreddit": "reddit.com", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 3, "author": "bicycle_repair_man", "created_utc": "1193315812", "children": [{"controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1427425417, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "archived": true, "name": "t1_c02b8ee", "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5z2cy", "downs": 0, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "body": " Pretty much correct.

And I think there are two popular responses to this kind of all-pervasive doubt:\n\n1) Acceptance of uncertainty, that we live in an uncertain world in which nothing can be 'known.'  This is the route of atheism.  (But that's not true!  Because atheism is the BELIEF that God does NOT exist!  How can you know that?  I disagree.  In practice, on must live as if God exists or as if God does not.  Atheism is the commitment to live as if God does not exist.  Of course that is 'unknowable' in some sense--LIKE EVERYTHING--but nevertheless, we must live.  I live as if gravity exists.  I live as if the sun will rise tomorrow.  I live as if what I eat affects my weight.  I live as if the laws of physics work.  I live as if there is no God.)  \n\n2) The--yes!--*arbitrary* choice to believe in some particular higher power with a particular set of characteristics.\n\nI think #2 is decided by people out of fear of uncertainty.  Living in an uncertain world in which nothing can be known is scary, and certainty is comforting.  Hence belief in #2.\n\nThis explains why the religious are personally threatened by atheists: they remind the religious of the reality of their own doubt.\n\nDoubt is the human condition.  You can accept it--as it is, after all, self-evident--or you can reject it.  You can live in fear of losing your faith, or you can lose your faith and lose your fear.  It's up to you.

Now the question is not so much \"can god be proven/disproven\" but \"what is the likelyhood that there is a god\"? This question is not particularly trivial, but we can start answering it by contrasting a god-ful universe and a god-less universe. If we take a notion of a god that intervenes in the world, then the probability that god exists is bound with the probability that physical laws as we know them are violated. Considering the degree of accuracy of our current physical models, this appears very unlikely. Considering the notion of a god who makes no difference (note that this is not a notion many theists are interested in anyway) we need to use another tool of probabilistic thinking. Basically, since both probability landscapes (god-ful and god-less) look exactly the same, we must now make use of some information theory and ask ourselves: which of these landscapes contains less complexity? A universe with a god who makes no difference still requires physical laws in order to be able to describe the probability landscape which we can observe, but the probability landscape we can observe does not require a god. Thus, a universe without a god is a shorter program which generates the same output, and ceteris paribus we must choose shorter programs (since every extra bit multiplies the probability of being right times 2 assuming a random distribution).\r\n", "author": "modulus", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "archived": true, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "name": "t1_c02b8an", "parent_id": "t1_c02b813", "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02b8an"}, {"subreddit": "reddit.com", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 3, "author": "isnthatheway", "created_utc": "1193317366", "children": [{"subreddit": "reddit.com", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": -2, "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": "1193317660", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_6", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 1, "author": "sdoorex", "created_utc": "1193327696", "children": [{"controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 1, "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5z2cy", "retrieved_on": 1427425385, "score": 1, "body": "  Did you read the posts above ?

There is absolutely no evidence upon which to base the choice to do so.  I could claim that giant super-intelligent invisible raccoons are the true motivating force behind the universe.  This sounds, admittedly, somewhat insane, but logically there is just as much reason to believe in these raccoons as there is in more traditional Gods.  People with religious beliefs expect a double standard of society.  On one hand, they wish to be able to condemn people who believe in giant invisible almighty raccoons as insane, but do not want people applying the same standard of proof to their belief in whatever God they have chosen arbitrarily.\n\nBecause of this, as i stated earlier, religious people must not use their critical faculties on the beliefs espoused by their own religions.  Of course, this can be problematic, especially in people with well developed minds, as the natural tendency of many people is to look for flaws in reasoning.  It becomes much easier for people to ignore these flaws, however, in situations where they feel a sense of community with like minded people.  That is to say, it is much easier to maintain beliefs if everyone around you believes them.  \n\nTo maintain this sense of community, it becomes necessary for some people to deny that the opposite point of view exists.  People often see in themselves a tendency to doubt their own beliefs, especially in the face of rational thought, and also project this tendency onto their fellows.  People also tend to have an overwhelming desire to retain their beliefs in the face of this doubt.  Because of this, opposing points of view become a threat, and people do their best to suppress these points of view, because they find themselves unable to oppose them logically.\n\nTo illustrate, it has been my experience that atheist and agnostics are almost always willing to discuss other peoples views, and compare them with their own, using the principles of logic and rationale to examine them.  People who have strong religious beliefs are also willing to discuss their views, but often they lose this willingness as soon as critical examination of their views becomes the topic of conversation.  \n\nPeople who base their beliefs on empirical evidence have little to fear from critical thinking, but to people who choose their views arbitrarily, and wish to retain those views, critical and opposing ideas are a huge threat to the maintenance of their belief system.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "parent_id": "t3_5z2cy", "id": "c02b7ao", "author_flair_css_class": null}

I call BS.\r\n\r\n&gt;Atheism, by the way, was not all that widespread during the Enlightenment, which was, after all, the age of Absolutism as well.\r\n\r\nIt didn't say it was, only that the rise of rationalism during this period led to the start of Atheism as a concept, among many other advances based on Rationalism.\r\n\r\n&gt;Are you aware of Newton's beliefs about, for example, astrology and ghosts?\r\n\r\nActually, I was, but see the above paragraph.  We also don't believe in the four humors, either, but that doesn't belie the fact that medicine as we know it began in an era when those beliefs were still prominent.  Both Atheism and modern medicine moved past the bogeymen of their age.  Unfortunately, religion has been a lot harder to dislodge than phrenology.\r\n\r\n&gt;I am intrigued that you belief that there is an atheist 'belief system'. What are its tenets?\r\n\r\nI refer to a belief system because it is easier to talk about Atheism this way, especially with believers who tend to conceive of Atheism like any other religion.  You are correct in that it is no more than just a belief in rationalism and empirical evidence and likely shouldn't have even a title.\r\n\r\nUltimately, you can't have you logical cake and eat it, too.  You cannot demand that I produce the tenets of Atheism on one hand, implying that there aren't any and that I'm illogical for treating it as a belief system, while simultaneously offering up NK as an \"atheist nation\" on the other.  In order for NK to even be considered an Atheist nation, they have to believe in Atheism ...\r\n\r\n&gt;Already explained, twice. You should really read a little serious philosophy: it might lend some strength to your arguments.\r\n\r\nAs I've said above, BS.  You picked NK to prove a point, I called you on it, and now you are backing down claiming that it was just a response to a request.  Baloney.\r\n\r\n&gt;You should really read a little serious philosophy: it might lend some strength to your arguments.\r\n\r\nWhere do you want to go next?  I've got a bookshelf right in front of me ...

They have a minimum standard for a reasonable belief (some evidence of his existence) and won't believe until that shows up. God is in the tank with ghosts, ESP, astrology and every other questionable belief until more proof arrives to justify it being considered more seriously.  Some Atheists go well beyong this reasonable skepticism, of course, but it is not the outright refutation that most people assume.
