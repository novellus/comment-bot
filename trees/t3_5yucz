The old climate models WERE wrong! However, they were wrong in that they predicted a 3 degree warming in 100 years when they really should have predicted a 6 degree warming in 50 years.\n\nSo as wrong as the older climate modelers were, the anthropogenic deniers were doubly wrong. They were wrong in their claims that climate models were \"fear mongering\". (In reality, they didn't cause enough concern by downplaying how fast these changes can happen.) They were also wrong in their predictions that the mean temperatures were going to be much lower than what the models predicted.\n\nIt's would be funny to hear them bleat their lies if only it didn't have such severe, real world ramifications.\n", "author": "entropyfails", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 3, "parent_id": "t3_5yucz", "id": "c02aku9", "author_flair_css_class": null}
