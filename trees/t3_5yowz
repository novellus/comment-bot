They implemented social security over the complaints of those who recognized the program could be abused.\r\n\r\nThis particular article illustrates all of Harry Browne's \"[The 7 Never-to-be-Forgotten Principles of Government](http://www.harrybrowne.org/articles/PrinciplesOfGovernment.htm)\":\r\n\r\n1. **Government is force.** Every government program, law, or regulation is a demand that someone do what he doesn't want to do, refrain from doing what he does want to do, or pay for something he doesn't want to pay for. And those demands are backed up by police with guns.\r\n2. **Government is politics.** Whenever you turn over to the government a financial, social, medical, military, or commercial matter, it's automatically transformed into a political issue \u2014 to be decided by those with the most political influence. And that will never be you or I.\r\n3. **You don't control government.** It's easy to think of the perfect law that will stop the bad guys while leaving the good guys unhindered. But no law will be written the way you have in mind, it won't be administered the way you have in mind, and it won't be adjudicated the way you have in mind.\r\n4. **Every government program will be more expensive and more expansive than anything you had in mind when you proposed it.** It will be applied in all sorts of ways you never dreamed of.\r\n5. **Power will always be misused.** Give good people the power to do good and that power eventually will be in the hands of bad people to do bad.\r\n6. **Government doesn't work.** Because government is force, because government programs are designed to enrich the politically powerful, because you can't control government and make it do what's right, because every new government program soon wanders from its original purpose, and because politicians eventually misuse the power you give them, it is inevitable that no government program will deliver on the promises the politicians make for it.\r\n7. **Government must be subject to absolute limits.** Because politicians have every incentive to expand government, and with it their power, there must be absolute limits on government.", "author": "coldwarrior", "created_utc": "1192839092", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5yowz", "id": "c02a6fk", "author_flair_css_class": null}
