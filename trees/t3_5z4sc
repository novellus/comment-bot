It had something to do with people; there was friction between several old D personalities and Alexandrescu. They gave him a (I feel undeserved) roasting, and he didn't come back.\n\nMaybe he was too eager when he first appeared, and some people took offense that he had ideas as a newcomer. I don't really know, except that I thought it was all quite silly. \n\nIt's a pity too, because now there's no way to have any discourse with him. He and Walter discuss things out of sight, so very few people can provide feedback or additional ideas until things have already gelled. Then these ideas are sometimes thrown out or changed substantially once the rest of the community _does_ get a chance to provide feedback -- often after has been implemented -- which is a waste of everyone's time.  \n\nOf course, too many cooks can spoil a broth too, so maybe this is for the best. Everyone has their own pet feature, so you end up with a language that looks similar to its closest relative.
