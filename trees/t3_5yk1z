The violent act put him in crutches and left him with a slight, but permanent limp. When police became involved, he was the one who was arrested. He says the reason for his arrest that at 6\u20191\u201d, 210 pounds and a military veteran, he appeared far more intimidating than his wife, who is average in size. He claims she was initiating the violence between them and using weapons. Blumhorst sought shelter protection but was repeatedly denied service because the shelters only received state funds which served women. He sought services again to prove his point for a case, which was eventually thrown out in 2005 for lack of legal standing to file a lawsuit by the Second District Court of Appeal. He then joined with three other male plaintiffs who say they have had similar experiences and just want equal protection under the law.\n\n\u00b7 98% of women\u2019s shelters in California receive state funds.\n\u00b7 Only three shelters in California offer services to men.
