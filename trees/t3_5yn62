It helps, but there are better ways of looking at it.\n\nIf you ask \"why is there less pressure on the top\", it tends to lead to an explanation via Bernoulli's equation (saying that p + \u00bd\u03c1v\u00b2 + \u03c1gz is constant along a streamline), a way of expressing conservation of mechanical energy in a fluid.  You start from the kinematics of the flow (the shape of the streamlines over the wing) and satisfy yourself that this leads to a pressure differential.\n\nThis works fine for rooftops - it's obvious that the air is moving fast (=&gt; low pressure) over the rooftop and quiescent at atmospheric pressure underneath.  But for an aerofoil, it doesn't really answer **why** the kinematics of the flow are as they are.\n\nIt turns out that to describe the airflow over a wing mathematically, we need to account for a 'circulation' around the wing - the flow is turned by the aerofoil, and we need to account for why.  Why does it do this, instead of just detaching  from the top surface?  This is where discussions of shear forces in boundary layers come in - they tell us why the kinematics of the flow are as they are, allowing us our nice Bernoulli-explanations.\n\nBy the way, you don't need to use terms like \"not because of the force of the wind, but because of the pressure differential.\"  Pressure and forces are all tied up together in fluid, it's not suggesting a completely different physical mechanism.
