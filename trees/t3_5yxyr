(Why do you think Petraeus is the top US commander in Iraq right now?  I'll tell you why; because he is well versed in classic counterinsurgency and as Tom Ricks reported in \"Fiasco: The American Military Adventure in Iraq,\" he was the single most successful American commander at the division level, in terms of running sustainable military operations in major Iraqi cities.)  The problem is that Petraeus and those officers who understand counter-insurgency doctrine are opposed by a great deal of \"institutional inertia,\" in addition to the need to make up for ground already lost.  It may be too late for them to turn the tide of the war, and as the war was/is a complete bungle in the first place, in the long run, counter-insurgency doctrine may be irrelevant in any case.  \n\nThat said, you are absolutely correct that the Brits had and probably have a far more sophisticated understanding of counter-insurgency than do their American counterparts.  There are two reasons for this.  The first and most obvious has, as you say, to do with Northern Ireland.  During the seventies and eighties the Brits learned a great deal about fighting a determined and entrenched opposition in an urban environment.  The second is not so obvious inasmuch as it has to do with what the Americans deliberately chose (at least in part) to forget about the war in Vietnam.   As it happens, the current crop of American commanding officers (with the notable exception of Petraeus) pretty much all cut their teeth as company commanders in Vietnam.  One might be forgiven for imagining that the mistakes made in that war would have been painfully obvious to them and that as such they would have gone to great pains to apply the lessons of counter-insurgency to the Iraq effort.  \n\nObviously they didn't, and to make a long story short and to grossly oversimplify things, it had ultimately to do with Reagan, the end of the Cold War, and the rise of American hubris.  (A good writer to read on the subject is Andrew Bacevich, \"The New American Militarism: How Americans are Seduced by War,\" if you're interested, though I realize that you probably aren't.)  \n\nAnyhow, I just wrote far more than I wanted to, got carried away, sometimes that happens.
