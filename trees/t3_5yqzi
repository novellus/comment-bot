PRIVATIZE EVERYTHING!!!! CORPORATE WELFARE! BAILOUT CITY! \r\n\r\nThen when the democrats take control and some corporations try to stuff some money their way, this shit-heel calls it \"The SAME THING\"... as if \"Look, There's No Difference!\"\r\n\r\nJust look at the picture of that shit-heel Paul Krugman, he's a stone cold conservative, 10 to 1. \r\n\r\nLet's see ..\r\n\r\n&gt;Paul Robin Krugman (born February 28, 1953) is an American economist. Krugman, a liberal, is currently a professor of economics and international affairs at Princeton University. \r\n\r\nOh Rly? A liberal he says? Just because he spoke out against Bush?\r\n\r\n&gt;Krugman worked on an advisory board for Enron throughout most of 1999, \r\n\r\n&gt;He is also a member of the international economic body, the Group of Thirty.\r\n\r\n&gt;The Group of Thirty was founded in 1978 by Geoffrey Bell at the initiative of the Rockefeller Foundation[1], which also provided initial funding for the body. Its first chairman was Johannes Witteveen, the former managing director of the International Monetary Fund. Its current chairman is Paul Volcker.\r\n\r\n&gt;Krugman is well known in academia for his work in trade theory, which provides a model in which firms and countries produce and trade because of economies of scale \r\n\r\n\r\nSo, you'd think a guy this much into economics would have something to say about say, Alan Greenspan. Or the IMF. Or the FED. Huh. Not much. Critiques Bush as being an idiot.
