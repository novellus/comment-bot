The most important point, from your link:\n\n&gt;The Internet is private property\n\n&gt;The Internet is not public property. Telecommunications companies have spent billions of dollars on network infrastructure all over the world. They did so in the hope of selling communications services to customers willing to pay for them. The government has no right to effectively nationalize ISP\u2019s by telling them how run their networks.\n\nFor some reason, the nature of property and of interpersonal transaction seems to completely change face, in many people's eyes, once it grows in scale.  For example, say that I \"start my own internet\" by connecting a few computers together on a network, not connected to the existing internet.  A few of my neighbors then decide they want to be able to connect their computers to mine, so I let them, for a price.  In my agreement with my neighbors, I specify by contract that I may give priority to certain types of traffic--and I may even block some others.  If my neighbors consent, few people on this thread would oppose my and my neighbors' rights to enter into such an agreement.  If my neighbors didn't like my terms, they would not consent.  In such a case, it's true that they would not have  access to my network, but overall, the deal I offered, using the equipment which I owned and operated, just wasn't worth it to them.  Few on this thread would argue that I should be forced to allow them access to my private network under different terms.\n\nBut other than as a matter of scale, how does this scenario differ from net neutrality?\n\nIf some ISP decides to throttle traffic to/from google.com and give priority to activity to/from ask.com--well, most internet users wouldn't like that.  In that case, they would be perfectly welcome to take their business elsewhere.\n\nThe existence of a suitable alternative depends upon just how much demand there is for such an alternative.  In the above example, I think it's clear that enough people would be sufficiently outraged by that stipulation so as to make it profitable for another ISP to offer people a service in which ask.com traffic is not prioritized.\n\nBut say, for example, that FOX News pays major ISPs billions of dollars in exchange for prioritizing their traffic, and as a result of that income, those ISPs can offer their service for a reduced price.  In the (very unlikely) event that this reduced price is enough to prevent small ISPs who practice net neutrality from stealing sufficient business away from the major ISPs--well, this is just a statement that most people like the monetary savings more than they like net neutrality--so still, everyone ends up happy.  (If the ISPs were hiding or lying about prioritizing FOX News traffic, then that's fraud, which is already illegal without this new regulation.)  You could argue that people's values were misplaced, but that's a problem that's fixed via education and the dissemination of information, not by passing legislation forcing people to get what they don't value.\n\nSuch ISPs can coexist.  Say, for example, that 10% of the population cares so much about P2P transfers that they *want* that traffic to be prioritized over other types of activity.  Those people can then choose to be serviced by ISPs who respect that decision, and the rest of the population can subscribe to neutral ISPs.\n\nThe point is that net neutrality, where properly valued, is taken care of automatically by the free market.  Passing legislation guaranteeing it just infringes upon the rights of businesses to control their property, and upon the ability of the people to buy what they want.", "author": "unitmike", "created_utc": "1193852106", "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c02ceqf", "parent_id": "t1_c02cdot", "id": "c02ceqf", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "name": "t1_c02cdot", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 2, "link_id": "t3_5zha0", "retrieved_on": 1427424882, "body": "Why do \u201cnet neutrality\u201d advocates ridicule politicians for comparing the Internet to a \u201cseries of tubes,\u201d and then trust them to regulate it?\n\nThe One Minute Case Against \u201cNet Neutrality\u201d\nhttp://oneminute.rationalmind.net/net%20neutrality/", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5zha0", "id": "c02cdot", "author_flair_css_class": null}
