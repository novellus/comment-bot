Americans feel secure and are ok with change when everyone is in the same boat. Hybrids are taking off because they have proven themselves to enough people so that others are willing to invest in them. But we still haven't found the best solution for our oil and car dependencies. Americans will take to an AFV but probably only one. I may be wrong but it seems to me that the major dilemma is not knowing which alternative fuel source is the best, not whether or not we will all be eventually driving AFVs.
