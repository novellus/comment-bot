This thesis promotes the idea that concepts from the world of functional programming can be captured with design pattern descriptions. These can then be used to benefit from functional programming concepts with ordinary object-oriented languages. The functional patterns are evaluated for their impact on language design and a new approach to a dual-paradigm language is presented. \r\n", "author": "g9yuayon", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2fwo", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c02bzqt", "parent_id": "t3_5zdbc", "id": "c02bzqt", "author_flair_css_class": null}

However, it is nothing a functional programmer wouldn't do when using an object-oriented language, and very little, if any, extra. In other words, it's the patterns that arise naturally from wanting to maintain referential transparency in an OO language as much as possible.\n\nThat said, I don't think it is of much value to object-oriented programmers without prior exposure to functional thinking.
