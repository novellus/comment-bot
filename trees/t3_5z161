A corporation is a juristic person; e.g., it can own things, it can exchange goods for services, and it can be sued.  It's not a natural person.  (I.e., it's not a human being.)

It also *protects* consumers in many ways:  I'll engage in transactions with agents of a company that could harm me if they do something incompetent or malicious that I wouldn't with a sole proprietor.  If I let the Comcast guy into my house and he drinks my beer, pees on my floor, and smashes my TV, I might not be able to track *him* down, but I can sure as hell sue Comcast.  It's also good for me running a business: I do my contracting under a *small* corporation (i.e., one employee); it makes it much easier to work with subcontractors, and it (hopefully) limits my liability if something goes awry.  I.e., they can take the company's assets, but they can't take my house.\n\nThe problem is not the actions of corporations, but actors (\"persons\", if you will) who have a lot of money and power, most of whom happen to *be* corporations.

Corporations are not physical things. They are in fact just the aggregate of the managers and corporate officers that work under a corporate banner.

I live in Toronto part of the year, the city is about $500 million dollars in the hole, the leftist mayor's solution is of course tax increases. Fine, if you got to do it, you got to do it. The problem is that one simple policy could cut that deficit from $100 to $250 million dollars per year without cutting *any* services! Toronto has an insane policy of contracting out services only to companies that pay union wages, instead of companies that quote the lowest price. \n\nSo potentially $250 million from taxpayers' purse is going to unions without the city having anything to show for it (the level of services it the same). \n\nThis is one level of government and one policy and theres $250 million being taken from one group of people and given to another - so fuck Corporations, whats being done about these thieves? And the left, of course, sees no problem here. In addition unions get so much god-damn bargaining power. The transit unions are given a monopoly over public transit in every city. During wage negotiation if the city doesn't cave, all they have to do is go on strike which will paralyze the entire city.

I'm not against good property law;  but I am for other kinds of law that benefit those without money. \r\n\r\nI mean, we've basically gone down the route of increasing market liberalism and seen increases in income inequality, disatisfaction, and insecurity. Comparable societies that have pursued more balanced policies have healthier and more contented people.  America seems to be rushing rightward because the rich who have been benefiting the most have a bottomless hungry for more, when all indications are that things look a bit more pleasant toward the middle.\r\n \r\nAnd I don't see how private property law addresses the problem of the polluted commons, for instance.  Who will protect the air, for example?  If there is only protection for private property, why *doesn't* that mean that air will become poisoned before the market cares about it?  It's only *then* that it's possible to make a buck --- by selling breathing tanks.  Even corporations are *looking* to government to act on global warming.  A market for carbon credits (a very sensible idea, I think) won't spring into existence without the enforcement function of government.  \r\n\r\nWhile selfish behavior combined with competition can produce terrific results in some areas (technology development); it can fail spectacularly in others where common interests are difficult to value throught trade.\r\n\r\nFinally, what happens to us as a people when we make self-interest the organizing principle?

There's an extremely high correlation between prosperity and a government that fairly and efficiently enforces property law.\n\nConsistent, enforceable property rights don't just benefit those with lots of property, they benefit those with very little.  In countries where you have to bribe people to register/keep/sell/build property, the poor are very much stuck being poor.  Think haiti,  nigeria, or even post-communist Russia.  In these countries property law is very inefficient and expensive to access.  It may be that's the way the law is written, or just how it's enforced.\n\nSo property rights are important.  I would argue that they are so important it's not a good idea to put them into the hands of an organization with a legal monopoly.  When that happens, everyone tries to control what everyone else does with their property, and the poor, who don't have the time or money to lobby, get screwed many times over.  And you end up with with a rather weak foundation for people to build and create wealth.\n\nIf property rights are enforced *WELL*, they benefit the poor more than anybody.

This is one of the doors I was opening when I wrote about the many flavors of property rights.  \r\n\r\nSo if intellectual property rights don't exist, how is an intellectual worker supposed to make money in a trade-based system?\r\n\r\nThere are quite a number of very subtle insights which come from research which lead to technology.  Insights which aren't immediately marketable that would be very difficult to generate if the only way we value work is by directly monetization (through trade).  And if we remove intellectual property protection, things get even worse for the research community.  So, I'm not sure I follow your logic.\r\n\r\n&gt; PS: I was there in 92 when the govt decided to back out of controling the internet and I witnessed the nuclear explosion in business and commerce and R&amp;D that happened immediately afterwards. It seems amazing to me how you're touting the \"socialist\" research system.\r\n\r\nI think that professional computer scientists have agreed (the Turing award, for instance) that TCP/IP was a better technology, and not an \"average\" non-proprietary one.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd PS: So was I.  Come on - how is insisting against evidence that proprietary solutions have always been best against reams of evidence (the entire US research infrastructure -- even Google came out of a PhD research project investigating the structure of backlinks on the web) -- I don't know what to say.  I develop technology, and have done so in industry and academia (currently the latter); there are some kinds of work which are done better in socialist systems (where you need time to think), and others in profit-driven ones. I say this not out of ideological pre-commitment, but out of very direct, personal experience.  If someone were to tell me we should go completely communist and peer-review based, I'd put up just as much of a fight.   \r\n\r\nIt seems like this puristic attitude toward laissez faire capitalism is the same kind of rigidity one encounters when talking to Marxists or Freudians.  Perhaps the problem is a kind of intellectual manicheanism?
