It's a total rehash of the original TFC, so much so that they really don't play very similar at all. \n\nThe idea is there and the map design is there,  but classes have been totally altered - the spy cloaks and is primarily used for disabling constructions now whereas it used to be an annoying little bee. The idea of the medic is also completely changed as their purpose changes from healing people every once in a while and pissing off the enemy with disease to being the most integral part to storming the enemy base. Pyros are now your worst enemy when forced into narrow corridors. Scouts are now an effective offensive force and can easily hold their own if played right. The demoman is now the ultimate defense against rapidly advancing enemies - the ability to mine places in any direction adds untold chances to surprise the enemy.\n\nIn fact, the only classes I can think of that have even retained the smallest portion of their original functions are the sniper, the soldier, and possibly the engineer (though the engineer has really been more suited to participate in offense as well).\n\nHonestly though, the play style of TF2 vs. TFC is utterly changed. TFC is a frantic, thoughtless, uncooperative bloodbath while TF2 has to be played with teamwork, precision, and vital role-filling.", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh03", "name": "t1_c029so1", "parent_id": "t3_5yj0v", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}
