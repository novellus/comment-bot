This basically comes down to the following.  A CEO (which is, by the way, a business position rather than a technical one) gave an imcomplete answer when asked about security.  He might have gotten one thing wrong, depending on interpretation.  The author is more concerned that he didn't address a bunch of details.\r\n\r\nWhat's missed here is this is the brief answer of one business person in response to an interview.  It's not a technical document; it's not all that the company will tell you about security.  Clearly, their web site says more, because the author found more information there.  It is ludicrous to expect the CEO to launch an impromptu 15-minute speech covering every possible objection, including testing regimens and formal verification of the correctness of their code, in that context.  I'd pay no attention to this whatsoever.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
