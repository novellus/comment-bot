However if the anonymous sources referenced in the linked Wikipedia article are correct, I agree that it does appear Iran was seeking nuclear warhead design plans.\n\nRegardless of whether they intended to build a weapon immediately, or sell copies of the plans to their friends, or simply have the option of building a weapon later, any attempt to acquire nuclear weapon designs is a clear violation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (which they have signed and previously violated).  \n\nYou'd think if the US was so determined to get tougher sanctions for Iran out of the UN we would've been waving this evidence in everyone's face for the last 4 years.  Maybe it's still a secret because it looks too much like entrapment.\n\nSorry for my condescension earlier.
