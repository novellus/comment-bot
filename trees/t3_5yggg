I thought that atheism meant not believing in God.  Nowhere in the definition of Atheism is any kind of assertation that we can know everything there is.  I doubt any atheist would ever claim such a thing.\r\n\r\nOf course there is more to existence than what we sense or experience or comprehend.  Does this prove the existence of God?  Or simply the limitations of the human mind? \r\n\r\nReligion's domain is that of human ignorance.  As human knowledge expands, religion's domain shrinks.  If any religion had ever \"gotten it right\", then, the expansion of human knowledge would not shrink Religion's authority, but merely overlap with it.  However, every time we learn something new, it curiously seems to ALWAYS disprove whatever prevous religious theory attempted to explain it.  \r\n\r\nIf religion could even ONCE predict something that was later verified by science, I might be able to give the theists some credit.
