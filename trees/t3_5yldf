Furthermore, expecting scientists to toe a particular ideological line is dangerous to the quality of the science. Last but not least, there may be a little something to what Watson says, and only a man late in a storied career with nothing to lose is going to be able to say it and not be dismissed as a crackpot. That's too valuable a thing to discourage even if you disagree with Watson specifically.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
