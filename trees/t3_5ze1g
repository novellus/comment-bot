Making it flat out illegal is also irresponsible as it empowers gangs and creates crime. Also, if it's illegal and someone wants marijuana, they go to their dealer who tries to upsell more addictive and lucrative drugs. Making it legal removes the gateway drug effect. So there must be a balance between the two and this results in a marijuana age. It is the best balance between the two ends of the spectrum. Going from making it legal for all to making it legal for those 21 and above will decrease the marijuana available to children. Making it flat out illegal does nothing but increase crime and create a market for hard drugs, the statistics of the USA vs Holland [speak for themselves](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=1005121101168). Is that how you think about the children - making it so the streets are filled with crime, making sure they don't venture off into the drug dealer's neighborhood? How about really start thinking about the children.
