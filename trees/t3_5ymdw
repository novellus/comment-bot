This means that for both GPU and CPU, memory access should be roughly as fast as with a more traditional architecture.\n\nI imagine that any data in memory with the right format can be used as a texture right away, with a simple call to the GPU.

The trick that nobody has mastered is how to deliver this level of performance with the flexibility to do the interesting stuff in GPU or CPU. Yet.\n\nBut people are getting there. For example, [Octrees are possible on the GPU](http://lefebvre.sylvain.free.fr/octreetex/), by using a structure that is quite similar to linked lists (pointers to cells). Plus GPU architects are working very  hard to make dynamic control flow more and more performant so you can traverse those data structures without always getting into the worst case scenario.\n\nGPGPU people want the flexibility, that is correct, but GPU need to keep up on graphics performance. For example the new shader model  (4.0) allows data of arbitrary length to be streamed out of a shader. In practice, you can currently only stream out 1024 32-bit values per processed element, but performance drops significantly on current GPU even when you push more then 128 values. That is a good example on how flexibility is getting into GPU architecture, but it also shows that it needs a lot of time for new features to become fast. \n\nBasically that's because nvidia cannot say something like: \"Ok our new graphics card can do geometry shader very fast now, but we dropped half of our pixel fill rate\"", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2fwo", "name": "t1_c02a1mb", "parent_id": "t3_5ymdw", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}
