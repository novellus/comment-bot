My bad. Further digging in Wikipedia lead me to the following:\n\n&gt; Libertarianism's resemblance to liberalism \n&gt; is superficial; in the end, libertarians \n&gt; reject essential liberal institutions. \n&gt; Correctly understood, libertarianism \n&gt; resembles a view that liberalism \n&gt; historically defined itself against, the \n&gt; doctrine of private political power that \n&gt; underlies feudalism. Like feudalism, \n&gt; libertarianism conceives of justified \n&gt; political power as based in a network of \n&gt; private contracts. It rejects the idea, \n&gt; essential to liberalism, that political \n&gt; power is a public power, to be impartially \n&gt; exercised for the common good.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism#.22Classical_liberalism.22_and_libertarianism\n\nFrom what I've seen (granted I've not been around all that long), at least in the States (and other Western democracies), I have faith that people in communities help each other out. How else can you explain organizations like the Red Cross, the United Way, the Salvation Army and Goodwill, which are all private charities (just to name the big ones - locally here in Houston, there are many, many more)? If people were truly as selfish as you claim, how could these organizations exist?\n\nI didn't make it clear, but I wasn't referring to the left/right spectrum but rather the public/private spectrum. I think it is unnecessarily divisive to say that someone who is for more privatization (in the classical liberal sense) vs more intervention (in the progressive sense) must necessarily be on opposing \"sides\". Each \"side\" has different ideas, but there is much common ground. Instead of fighting over the differences, isn't it better to learn from one another and leverage the similarities?\n\nIn any case, I've always felt that I've had a libertarian bent, when really, I'm liberal but apparently in the opposite direction from you.
