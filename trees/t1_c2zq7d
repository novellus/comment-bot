In the U.S., grad students can work toward 2 different degrees: a master's degree and a PhD (where, you typically get a masters on the way toward a PhD). Both are graduate degrees. Both have grad students working toward them.\n\nThe difference between them is, a master's degree means you've mastered the relevant subject matter. A PhD means you've not only mastered the subject matter, but also proven that you can actually do real research in that subject (and have your work peer-reviewed by other researchers in the field).\n\nSo, I'd say, if by the time you get a PhD you're not able to do peer-reviewed research in your field, you're a failure (specifically, a failure only at being a PhD in your chosen field).\n\nI think lulzlulz was talking about this specific kind of failing, and not in the insulting \"you're a failure\" sort of way.\n ", "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": "1192497162", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "programming", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_c2zq7d", "id": "c029egt", "author_flair_css_class": null}
