It sounds interesting but I think maybe you've worded it imprecisely. Neverminding the fact that spheres don't have handles, it seems trivial that any graph can be embedded on a sphere if you allow edge crossings. If you don't allow edge crossings, then obviously only planar graphs have embeddings. What am I missing here? Did you mean to say manifold instead of sphere? Is there some extra degree of freedom, like the dimension of the manifold or the number of handles? Would your desired algorithm try to minimize these other parameters? Or maybe minimize edge crossings? Help me out here. I'm not a graph theorist so these things aren't \"well known\" to me.
