Deism is merely a belief in some organizing force in the universe. This universal force may take the form of an overriding intelligence that merely observes, or sometimes intervenes in, human affairs. For some, it's the glue that binds our molocules into coherent form, or it could also be the the better part of our human nature. In short, there's a \"something\" that's above and beyond, keeping everything organized. It's all up to us humans to come to terms with this \"whatever\" on our own terms. For instance, as a deist, I believe that organized religion is the greatest of folly and tragedy, as it deprives the supplicant of reason and replaces contemplation with a cardboard \"God\", srtuck in man's image -- and just as angry and bigoted.
