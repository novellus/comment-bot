Only the presence of people with money and the desire to buy art will help art.\n\nIn the absence of govt meddling, the arts would be better off. You are correct in saying that rich people are the ones buying art right now. That's because they have the most disposable income. If we got to keep more of our money, the middle class would have the opportunity to buy art b/c they would have more disposable income to spend on things THEY deem to be important. Now, of course, not everyone would spend that money on art. Some people are not into art. Why should people who aren\u2019t into art have to subsidize artists? If there is such a lack of demand for art that it requires government involvement to support it, what does that say about art?\n\n&gt; Gasp, it is almost the same as if a group of people came together without government influence to attempt to beautify something, and had funding for it!

So many societies throughout history have tried and failed. Wealth is not distributed evenly in a centrally planned society. The class structure disappears. There are no lower, middle, and upper classes. Only party-line affiliates and non-party-liners. Hopefully you know which of these two groups prospers (hint: it's not the non-party-liners)...\n\nWhy not let individuals decide for themselves how they want to live their life, make their own mistakes, and reap the rewards of their successes?
