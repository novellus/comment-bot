Beginning with the basics of eyewitness fallibility, such as poor viewing conditions, brief exposure, and stress, Loftus moves to more subtle factors, such as expectations, biases, and personal stereotypes, all of which can intervene to create erroneous reports. Loftus also shows that eyewitness memory is chronically inaccurate in surprising ways. An ingenious series of experiments reveals that memory can be radically altered by the way an eyewitness is questioned after the fact. New memories can be implanted and old ones unconsciously altered under interrogation.", "author": "Codebender", "created_utc": "1193352379", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_c02bcky", "id": "c02bd4x", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "name": "t1_c02bcky", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 1, "link_id": "t3_5z3gf", "retrieved_on": 1427425364, "body": "so if you kill someone out in public by say, kicking them in the throat, even if 15 people are circled around you as you do this, so long as you get away and burn your shoe in the fire, there is NOTHING left to incriminate you?
