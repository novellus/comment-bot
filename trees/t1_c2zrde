Though there were certainly other irregularities, Ohio is where they were the most flagrant and un-apologetic. I've only mentioned a few. You should really read up on them.\r\n\r\n&gt;the elections were \"stolen,\" the Supreme Court, Florida, Ohio, and various state and local boards of elections as well as the US Congress would all have to be on board with it, all in favor of the Republicans. \r\n\r\nIf you believe that, you don't understand the electoral college. In a close election, all it takes is to suppress the opposition vote in a swing state. The Secretary of State can pretty much do this on his own via inequitable distribution of voting machines, throwing out or refusing to process the other side's voter registrations, posting wrong poll addresses on the official website (something else that happened in Ohio) then throwing out the votes of all who voted at the \"wrong\" precinct they were directed to online. \r\n\r\nWhile court challenges in Ohio on election day called a halt to some of the worst abuses/voter suppression efforts, it was too late in the day to make much difference. There is very little that can be done legally after the fact about voter suppression. \r\n\r\nAnd even less that can be done about miscounts on machines that leave no audit trail, incidentially.\r\n\r\nBut since you bring up other branches of government, the DOJ in Ohio went out of their way to avoid dealing with the issue of the inequitable distribution of voting machines that led to 7 hour long lines in some minority (presumably Democratic)  precincts. On the basis of exactly NO evidence, the DOJ official in charge announced that the # of voting machines didn't matter--it's just that black people vote later in the day.\r\n\r\n&gt;I am talking about the fact that all 3 branches of government would have to line up on all levels to \"steal\" an election\r\n\r\nAgain, simply not true. The courts in Ohio took a pretty dim view of the Republican shenanigans. But through no fault of their own, they were limited in the remedies they could offer. \r\n\r\n&gt;Please focus, and maybe to prove you are a decent citizen and a fair debater\r\n\r\nI don't need to \"prove\" anything to a person who thinks that the only way to steal an election is for all three branches of government to conspire. \r\n\r\n", "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c029ltz", "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c029ltz", "parent_id": "t1_c029lrn", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c029lrn", "ups": 1, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_2ziji", "retrieved_on": 1427426248, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c029lrn", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c029lmt", "body": "Well it may be useless to continue this covnersation because it looks like you are having a hard time taking me seriously as you've pretty much dismissed everything I've said.\n\n&gt;Dude, no you haven't.
