Politics should only be about issues and how people stand on them. \n\nAlthough really television ads are very similar to stump speeches in a way. The only difference is that at speeches it's harder to lie and bullshit. That's why Bush looks so bad now compared to how his speeches looked in the old days before America smoked his fucking ass out. But I digress.\n\nSo the ads aren't really the problem. I just think Kucinich needs to bust out some legislation like Ron Paul is doing and push that shit. Also I think a lot of people on the left are annoyed at Pelosi. So Kucinich couldn't go wrong by thumbing his nose at her. \n\nDodd scored some major points by threatening to filibuster the telecomm immunity bill. Kucinich could be doing that.

For example, the Clean Air Act has a name that is difficult to oppose, as do \"fair trade\" laws. Even a person's name impacts his or her success in life. One study showed that on average, schoolteachers grade essays written by children with names like David and Michael a full letter grade higher than those written by children with names like Hubert and Elmer.\"\n\nDennis might make people think of \"Dennis the Menace.\" It's subconscious.\n\nHis last name is Kucinich. Hard to spell. Isn't warm. What's it from?\n\n\nIf his name was short and punchy, like Don Nitch, he'd probably poll 10% higher *automatically.* Odd, but true.\n\nSame thing goes for Barak Obama. If he went by Barry Obama, he'd poll higher. Barry Bama, even higher. Barry Smith, even higher.\n\n\nSecond, Kucinich doesn't have a short, five-words-or-less description to differentiate himself from everyone else. He needs to trumpet that word or feeling over and over and over again.\n\nRudy Giuliani: 9/11 Mayor\nBarak Obama: Black\nHillary Clinton: Woman\nDennis Kucinich: ?\n\nSince he doesn't have a single compelling descriptor, he blends into the muddy background next to Gravel.\n\nIt's stupid that such important decisions in life hinge on bullshit advertising and marketing techniques.
