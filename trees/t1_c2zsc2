In those heady days of overt deism and covert atheism, enemies of religion could gather together, exchange stories of religious hypocrisy and savagery, and imagine that once the poisoned barbs of Christianity were removed from innocent human flesh, and priests and kings were suitably strung up by each other\u2019s entrails, the world would breathe a long and peaceful sigh of relief. That was before the French Revolution, before Stalin, before Hitler, before Mao, before Pol Pot; in short, before any actual attempt to politically eliminate either Christianity in particular or all religion in general, and set up a regime based entirely on secular foundations. Before it was ever tried in earnest, the intellectual atheist could wade through many a hypothetical reverie of the innocent and Edenic future of practical atheism. That is the whole problem with Hitchens\u2019s book: He still thinks he has that enviable luxury. His finale \u2014 a mere seven pages long \u2014 is titled \u201cThe Need for a New Enlightenment,\u201d as if it hadn\u2019t been tried already and found woefully wanting.\u201d (Benjamin D.
