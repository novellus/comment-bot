No one tries to identify the sex partner.  No one tries to determine the age of the perpetrator to determine if statutory rape is occurring.  No one reports the crime if it is rape.  No one tells the parents so they can act to stop the abuse.  No one tells the police about the crime. The school protects her abuser.    Conversely, if you slap your daughter and she has a single mark on her the school will immediately call social services the police and the parents stand a good chance of being arrested for corporal punishment.
