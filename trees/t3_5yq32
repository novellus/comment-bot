I own a 1950's Oyster but hardly ever wear it these days because of the \"status\" associated with it.  It's just a watch!\n\nIn the fifties and sixties, if you wanted a good quality, automatic, dependable, accurate, waterproof watch, Rolex was your best choice.  These days you can get a good mechanical divers' watch from, say, Citizen for a couple of hundred bucks.  Which is actually what's on my wrist at the moment.\n\nPlus your comment about keeping time \"for decades\"??  A mechanical watch just can't do that... you have to factor in lots of external factors.  In fact a friend of mine who bought a new Oyster a few years back was mortified to find it was losing minutes per week.  Obviously adjustable, but it's not magic.\n\nThese days Rolex is only about being a status symbol.
