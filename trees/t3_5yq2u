The reasoning behind this is that it **inevitably leads to corporate-government collusion**.\n\nWhich is why the HMOs -- a primary source of Americans' fiscal health-insurance woes -- felt it would be profitable to spend almost a quarter-billion dollars on trying to convince our government to basically hand them over a blank check in the form of SCHIP. It is worth noting that fascism is in a very real sense a form of socialism: the name of Hitler's party (No, that is NOT Gershwin's law, dammit !! &gt;_&lt;  ... lol) was the [National Socialist Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Socialist).\n\nNow, I'm not against making things easier on the poor -- not by ***any*** means. But we must always remember that there is always more than one way to skin a cat, and that our current way of attempting to do so is effectively fascist. If we were really that worried about the health of our nation's children, we could for example simply issue tax credits to any family with children whose net income is below a certain amount. This is a very similar concept to what many wish to do with the public education system. \n\nIn both cases this would be a strong step towards liberalizing the market... but you will notice that ***nowhere*** is this suggested.

Churches do not scare me except when they get all evangelical, apocalyptic and lovey-dovey with the government.  I recognize that ideally, Church and Family are two institutions which stand in opposition to State power.  An increase of State power can only come about through a weakening of the other two.\n\nI am not terribly religious but I believe along with the founders that we get our rights from our Creator.  We certainly do not get them from the State or Federal Government.  All government can do is occasionally and ideally, protect, and more often and typically, violate our rights.\n\nWhat about the phrase Human Rights is not vague?  If you delineate them, you limit them.  The Bill of Rights does not contain our only rights -- it only states a few and merely to be completely clear about them so that you can't miss it.  If you give the job of protecting Human Rights solely to the Federal Government or any other group, you are asking the fox to guard the henhouse.  Ultimately, you must protect your rights and you must understand how your society and government work in order to do so.  Unfortunately many educated, intelligent people seem not to have the slightest clue.\n\nI have gay friends, I have been around gay people and lived in \"gay areas.\"  I am no homophobe.  However, I am not convinced that big-M Marriage should be anything other than what it has been -- an institution through which a man and woman commit to each other in order to produce, raise up and nuture the future generation.  In college I used to think polyamory was cool too and that Robert Heinlein style N-way relationships would be a good idea.  In practice, forget it.\n\nGay people are wonderful and I applaud committed relationships among them, and I support them in adopting whatever kind of relationships they want but tinkering with the definition of Marriage so that it can be extended to the tiny number of gay people who will actually use it seems like a bad idea to me and will likely backfire.\n\nMarriage is not well these days and gay people seem just a little too eager to jump on board something most heteros seem ambivalent about at best.  Gay Marriage has somehow become the end-all be-all of homosexual political rights and interests.  Don't they have other concerns?  Why is that one issue now some kind of litmus test?  Ten years ago they were just getting people to talk about civil unions and that would have been seen as a great victory.  Now that civil unions could be had relatively easily in most states, it's Gay Marriage or bust.  All this will do is excite the socially conservative opposition into writing a definition of Marriage into law.  \n\nIt's politically dumb if you ask me but this is the result of using the Federal Government to force unpopular laws on us.  We could all get along better if we realized we have a Constitutional Republic and there are some things it cannot do.  It was designed specifically to stop powerful minorities or slight majorities from forcing their agenda on the rest of the people.  What is appropriate in one state is not necessarily so in another.\n\nI am with Ron Paul, if you want a definition of Marriage, look it up in a dictionary but don't start writing it into Law, certainly not at the Federal level.\n\nPrivate social and religious institutions should eclipse the State in importance -- not because they should be so domineering and powerful but because the state should be so darned SMALL.\n\nSorry for the essay.", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"subreddit": "politics", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 0, "author": "swinghammer", "created_utc": "1192888801", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": -2, "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": "1192914513", "children": [{"controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "created_utc": "1192977414", "name": "t1_c02ae8a", "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5yq2u", "retrieved_on": 1427425879, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02ae8a", "author": "[deleted]", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "politics", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_c02aasq", "body": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "politics", "name": "t1_c02aasq", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": -2, "link_id": "t3_5yq2u", "retrieved_on": 1427425923, "body": "[deleted]", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02a96e", "id": "c02aasq", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "ups": 0, "name": "t1_c02a96e", "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5yq2u", "retrieved_on": 1427425944, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02a96e", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02a8ub", "body": "Of course it is vague and furthermore it's largely arbitrary.

Their corporate charters should come up for renewal every 5 years, and a public hearing held. The bar to renew should be high, and even a few valid complaints should be enough for it not to be. If not renewed, the corporation's physical assets are auctioned off, and the proceeds are apportioned among the former shareholders.

Their free speech rights would be nil, and state governments free to restrict advertising or other commercial speech.\n\nIn lawsuits, corporations would be restricted to spending only as much as their opponents... spending any significant amount above that would be grounds for a default judgement, and punitive damages.\n\nUnder the system I envision, a Ma Bell would easily lose their charter. A Google would barely get its renewed, and always be walking on eggshells. A Microsoft would have its board of directors dumped in a volcano.\n\nSince corporations are not persons, I see no reason to grant them any rights at all. As corporations are useful to the citizens of the US, they should be allowed, but kept on a very short leash. This does not restrict anyone's business rights... those willing to do the sole proprietorship/partnership/whatever thing would be free to do as they do now.\n\nI doubt this is Ron Paul's stance though.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02a99p", "id": "c02abua", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "politics", "name": "t1_c02a99p", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 13, "link_id": "t3_5yq2u", "retrieved_on": 1427425943, "body": "I very much agree that Paul is different; I think he's more principled than any of the other choices.

If the marketplace for service provision is healthy (and it is) and there is awareness of these issues then the problem will take care of itself. That's a better solution than one requiring regulation because regulation introduces red tape and hampers innovation by preventing variations that hadn't been considered (i.e. if news corporation wanted to sponsor high-speed network connections into a couple of providers to allow then to better stream certain services to their customers this should be allowed, but legislators won't anticipate all such things and thereby block innovation opportunities).\n\n&gt; These two things are deal-breakers for most\n&gt; liberal democrats I know..\n\nI understand that liberal democrat in the US tends to mean what we'd call a social democrat in the rest of the world. Paul isn't from that tradition - he's from the 'old' whig tradition that characterised the philosophies of the British Liberal Party before it was called the Liberal Party.\n\nOf late pretty much everyone of significance in the Anglosphere has been a centralising social democrat of one form or another. John Major and forward in Britain, continuous in Australia since Fraser (who wound back universal health care), New Zealand, Canada, etc. In practice Bush is as well - although he does things that people who identify as liberal democrats in the US disapprove of, he accepts the settlement of (1) increasingly powerful state and (2) government intervention in markets justified by making things better for people.\n\nThere would be people within the Green movements who are exceptions to this - they would be centralising and would prioritise the environment over social democratic outcomes. But green movements are accepting of the idea that in general government is a good mechanism of solving problems.\n\nPaul is quite unlike anything else going on in the political world because he pictures a framework of government that is distinctly different to current practice.\n\nI think he gains strength from having a respected constitution to work with, but in some respects it limits him. I hold that federalism is a demonstrated failure, and that a much better outcome for people of our tradition would be small states. So for the united states, you'd actually break it up into self-administering republics compete with one another for lifestyle and economy but which have very point by point agreements to allow them to keep down unnecessary restrictions to trade and the like - effectively what Australia and New Zealand have between one another at the moment.\n\nThis is what federalism was meant to be in the first place but the granularity of the constitutions in those countries was bad and has led to dominant federal governments. The handling of defence is a key issue in this because as soon as you put it in the hands of the federal government the obvious follow on from that is to give the federal government foreign affairs powers, and it's all down hill from there as Australia has seen with the external affairs power being invoked as a mechanism that allows the federal government to shop around for treaties to match an outcome it wants to force on a state.\n ", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "politics", "archived": true, "name": "t1_c02a972", "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5yq2u", "retrieved_on": 1427425944, "score": 4, "score_hidden": false, "body": "&gt;Ron Paul is against Net Neutrality..

There is much that I disagree with him about but there is much more that I can agree with. Libertarian Socialism is probably the end result of true liberty. But we need to take steps to get there. The first and most important step is radical decentralization. True liberty cannot exist under the auspices of a violent unlawful leviathan such as the U.S. federal government. I just don't understand this trust of the State as some sort of god. We must throw off the chains of violent coercion at every level possible and return governmental power to the most decentralized loci.

Seriously though - you may disagree with Ron's political philosophy but at least he has one that is consistent and well reasoned. Its just a little bit too complex for some of you statist/collectivist types to understand. Here is a hint behind Ron's reasoning. All government power derives from coercive violence. Violence is bad. By decreasing governmental power we increase individual liberty and responsibility thereby allowing for the spontaneous organization of free and responsible individuals. These freely formed organizations are better than the organization called the State because these organizations are formed voluntarily rather than through the threat of violence. These newly formed organizations - free of the duress of State sanctioned coercion - can take care of problems such as making sure children receive healthcare better than that entity of repression we call the State. \nSo for all of you Leftists out there this is your first lesson in the freedom philosophy that Ron Paul represents. Ron Paul will stand opposed to any law which attempts to usurp authority that has not been granted by the Constitution. Ron will do this every time because he has philosophical ideals and because he is a man of integrity. This is not  that hard to understand. Get educated.

I don't believe most of the people who WROTE the constitution were strict constitutionalists.  It was supposed to be abridged, which you no doubt realize, in the form of amendments, but it also wasn't supposed to be adhered to in the strictest of senses.  If we're committing acts that go directly against the constitution, then that needs to be addressed, but just because a particular action happens to NOT be addressed doesn't mean that it's unconstitutional. \n\nThe federal government has business in a lot of places where the constitution doesn't explicitly outline or even mention the legality or illegality of it.  Slavery, healthcare(potentially, I'm not even sure), the FBI to protect the nation and aide in the capture of interstate criminals, the FDA to ensure that businesses are at least following the very loosest but most important guidelines(they have strict laws but it's difficult to enforce them all).  Certainly, there are places where the fed has no business.  The DEA comes to mind immediately, and health care, again, pending on your position.\n\nTaking a reactionary and extreme stance just because SOME things are wrong is everything that is wrong with America.  Rather than just fix issues and compromise for the better(and rational), we have two diverging points of interest that everyone seems to follow one way or the other.  Strict constitutionalism adds a third, but that doesn't make it any more rational or correct.  \n\nThat said, abortion does seem tantamount to murder to some.  It may just be a little clump of cells, but that's pretty much all any infant is up until age 3.  No one ever stops developing until they die, but that's no excuse to cut the development short.  Rape and serious birth complications are, but not a post conception contraceptive.  The morning after pill is a little harder to determine, but if abortion really is a moral equivalent to murder, it has every right to be in the constitution, being that it impedes on the life and liberty of another human.\n\n", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02a9z5", "id": "c02aa1s", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "politics", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 4, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5yq2u", "retrieved_on": 1427425934, "body": "The constitution is \"incontrovertibly true.\" You can't just say that it is a system or set of principles that a \"process is carried on.\" It is the supreme law of the land and to violate it creates a chaotic mess.

Canada's government has collapsed repeatedly, as have many of Europe's and Africa's.

I mean, seriously: \"90% of sick people die\"??  \n\n* One: [There are real and serious arguments against government ownership/involvement of/in industry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_ownership#Against).\n\n* Two: If a company goes out of business, the infrastructure it built typically remains behind. It's simple enough: Company gets venture capital to build a toll bridge. Company builds bridge, but fails to make enough revenue in tolls to repay its creditors. Company goes out of business, and sells off the bridge to another group in order to liquidate its assets.  Final owner gets bridge, uses tolls to maintain its assets indefinitely, with only a portion going to maintenance.

Ron Paul was the Libertarian Party Presidential nominee of 1988. He had stepped down as a Republican Congressman to do so.

He's likely to cause another flare-up on the abortion issue, and this despite the fact that I agree that it is morally wrong... I don't think that this is something that can be fixed legislatively. I'd rather they did something to reduce or eliminate the need for abortion.\n\nDespite finding the basic gist of libertarianism correct, I'm really hesitant to just announce on the bullhorn \"Corporate free-for-all, every man for himself\".\n\nI don't blindly trust him. But most years I don't vote at all, there's usually no difference. This time, there might be, and he can do more good than he can do harm.\n\nIraq will be fixed.\n\nThe war on drugs eliminated, those with non-violent drug convictions will be pardoned.\n\nGovernment spending will be forced to be fixed. The Federal Reserve cut out of the action, personal income tax no longer used to spend spend spend.\n\nSocial security will be fixed... those currently entitled will continue to receive what they deserve, the rest of us, those younger, we'll have to start saving for retirement like we should already be doing.\n\nIllegal wiretapping will be a thing of the past. Torture will be. Guantonimo will be. The Cuba bullshit will be over. We'll have diplomatic relations with Iran again, instead of the warmongery bluster.\n\nAnd, anything he screws up can be fixed in 4 years... at best the man is a one-termer.\n\nIf you want blind trust, go attack those who are voting for Hillary and Obama.", "author": "NoMoreNicksLeft", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "id": "c02abxv", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "politics", "name": "t1_c02abxv", "parent_id": "t1_c02ab1d", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "politics", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 3, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5yq2u", "retrieved_on": 1427425920, "id": "c02ab1d", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "name": "t1_c02ab1d", "parent_id": "t3_5yq2u", "body": " The difference is, it's un-American to blindly trust leaders like Bush, but when Ron Paul supporters do it for Ron Paul, it is ok.
