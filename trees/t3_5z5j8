Try CLISP on Linux, or ECL on BSD, or SCBL or CMUCL on Linux, or some nice commerical implementaiton like Corman Lisp on Windows.\r\n\r\nBut for an endless stream of newbies?  Your examples offer *programming* newbies, and not programmers who become *Lisp* newbies.  CLISP-on-Windows is absolutely the wrong choice for the former (I'd go with Corman Lisp here, if they use Windows), but maybe CL itself doesn't suit them.
