BAYU is an automated system that notices when computers on selected University networks appear to be uploading files using peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing technology. BAYU then notifies the person whose computer was used to upload. The system does not look at the content being uploaded, nor does it look at the content on the computer's hard drive. When BAYU has noticed P2P uploading, it will send an email with a link to educational information and University resources to the person whose computer it noticed. BAYU simply lets people know that a computer associated with them appears to be engaged in P2P uploading.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
