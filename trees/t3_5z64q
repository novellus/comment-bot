If they listen to me, great! One less person who doesn't really care about the results is not voting.\n\nInstead, we live in a society where people are encouraged to go to the polls as \"the cool thing to do.\" MTV encourages young people to vote while getting informed is not as strongly advocated.\n\nI mean, really, what percentage of voters do you think even know their current US Representative's name before they go to the polls on voting day? I'd wager that the vast majority just go and check the name of all the Republicans or all the Democrats.\n\nThen, we have even lesser positions like State Representative. It's near impossible to actually find any real information about these people. You can find out where they went to high school, whether their married, how many kids they have, but can't find out any serious information. What percent of voters know anything about this?\n\nSo yes, voting should be a decision that you should make for yourself. However, most people should be encouraged to vote less. Furthermore, people should be encouraged to go vote but not vote for every position that is on the ballot if you are just choosing people at random.
