In the interview, she and Bill explored the idea of \"corporatism\" in which the government functions as helper to big business.  She gave the metaphor that big corporations see the government as an ATM machine from which they withdraw funds, occasionally making deposits into the campaign funds of politicians in order to safeguard their continuing ability to withdraw, and that this \"corporatism\" began in the Reagan years and has snowballed since then.  In other words, nowadays politicians are simply partners, not regulators of corporate power but actually promoters, in the profit-at-any cost philosophy of corporations.\r\n\r\n*Shock Doctrine* (which I haven't had the opportunity to read yet) shows how politicians are able to do this against the will of the people.  You can watch a six minute video of the general idea [here](http://www.naomiklein.org/shock-doctrine/short-film).\r\n\r\nMy sense is that Ron Paul's justification of his policy is his rather fundamentalist reading of the Constitution, but that he see and wishes to address the problem of corporatism and to separate political and corporate power, putting the political power back into the hands of the voters and leaving the corporations to sink or swim on their own without the huge tax-payer subsidies they now collect.\r\n\r\nI feel that corpoprations should be democratically controlled by their workers with democratic oversight by society at large, so clearly I disagree with Paul's economic philosophy.  However, if some kind of miracle happens and Paul gets the Rupub nomination, I would certainly vote for him and his economic plan over the Clinton/Obama status quo.\r\n\r\nI believe in helping African nations, and other developing nations, but not with shipments of weapons or military interventions.  If Paul, Gravel, or Kucinich were elected, I think they could do a lot to get us out of the military quagmires we're stuck in, but they'd still have to deal with a mostly opposition Congress wheeling and dealing for pork, so doubt we'd see any big economic changes any time soon.", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"subreddit": "reddit.com", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": -2, "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": "1192863020", "children": [{"subreddit": "reddit.com", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 7, "author": "CampusTour", "created_utc": "1192864094", "children": [{"subreddit": "reddit.com", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 10, "author": "Flemlord", "created_utc": "1192864481", "children": [{"controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "created_utc": "1192865042", "ups": 2, "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5yp87", "retrieved_on": 1427425958, "score": 2, "body": "I don't mind if states and state universities want to research on their population's dime.

Joe Biden, Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd, former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich, and New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson had already pledged to end Drug Enforcement Administration-led medi-pot raids in states where use is legal. Although New York Sen. Hillary Clinton initially told MPP she was studying the issue, the New Hampshire group Granite Staters for Medical Marijuana now reports that during a campaign stop there on July 13, Clinton called the DEA raids \u201cterrible\u201d and pledged to stop them. Notably absent from the mix is Illinois Sen. Barack Obama who hasn\u2019t yet made any commitment to ending the raids. Instead, Obama has said only that raiding sick people shouldn\u2019t be a priority for the Dept. of Justice. \n\nEdit: Are telling me that his views on abortion are irrelevant because Roe v.
