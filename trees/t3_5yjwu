A few weeks ago I saw, in downtown city traffic, a guy with his child riding on a really homemade-looking rig bolted to the back of his bike.  It was a seat on an extra wheel riding crooked (the tire was at about an 80 degree angle to the ground) and held on to the bike by two wingnuts.\n\nThis guy has his kid riding inches from traffic, facing backwards on this half-assed setup, and I felt a little worried about the kid, honestly.\n\nAs I understand it, 'riding double' is simply illegal, no matter what the double rider's age or relationship to the driver.  And riding in city traffic is simply not smart, realistically.", "author": "matthank", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c029t9q", "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c029t9q", "parent_id": "t3_5yjwu", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}
