The big bug is that the hidden articles do not get moved to the hidden section, so if I accidently hide something I don't know how to get it back.  The last hidden articles in the hidden section are all from before the update.  I also tried going to the next page of the list, and I get a Page Cannot Be Displayed error. \r\n\r\nThe second error I have noticed since the update is that every once in a while I'll click the hide button, and the button will change to \"hidden\", but the article will never disappear, and when I reload the page the \"hidden\" article is still there, with the \"hidden\" status switched back to a Hide button.", "author": "ChagrinRiddle", "created_utc": "1193187002", "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_5yz20", "id": "c02ax7b", "author_flair_css_class": null}
