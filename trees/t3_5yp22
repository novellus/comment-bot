It would seem to me that comments would be a good idea, since there seems to be no other way to get the reddit staff to actually listen and respond to complaints. \n\nPerhaps the reddit staff will eventually learn one of the hardest lessons of all, when things go wrong, you must communicate MORE with your customers, leaving them in the dark will only cause things to spiral out of control. Thus, we have dozens of complaint threads on reddit, all desperately trying to get the attention of the reddit team. Meanwhile, other threads link to photos of the reddit team having a big party. Does the phrase \"fiddling while Rome burns\" occur to anyone besides me?\n\nThe reddit team just does not have its priorities straight. Trivial complaints about minor tweaks to CSS formatting, positioning of subreddit tags, etc. have all been addressed and released, apparently in response to user complaints. But the MAJOR bugs (like search) go unaddressed, with vague promises of a fix \"Real Soon Now.\" Perhaps this was not a good time for the staff to be photographed, drinks in hand, at a big party. I'd rather see photos of the staff slaving away at the keyboard. Save the partying for AFTER the system upgrade is OPERATIONAL.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
