If you delay packets to the point that they are no longer useful by the time they make it through (as little as a split second for VoIP, longer for other applications), are you still only delaying them, or are you blocking them?  And what is to stop Comcast from giving the same treatment to packets from companies it competes with, or companies who compete with someone who has paid them for \"priority\"?\n\nI'm very split on net neutrality, as I normally oppose regulation to the greatest extent possible.  But then I look at Comcast, who has a virtual stranglehold on broadband internet access in many or most of its markets, and have to wonder if their virtual monopoly should come with some regulatory strings attached.", "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "id": "c02aspn", "subreddit_id": "t5_2fwo", "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": "t3_5yxe8", "name": "t1_c02aspn", "author_flair_css_class": null}
