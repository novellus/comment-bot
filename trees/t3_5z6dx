While they have an influence, they are not even remotely near the reason why we are suffering so much.   In fact, the high price of oil isn't even high when measured in currencies whose value is not being watered down by 14% per year and rising.  Instead of saying that gas is going higher, we should be saying that the US dollar is getting lower because the Federal Reserve central bank is screwing everybody for the sake of their cronies on wall street.
