Religion is a very easy and reassuring way of identifying others as \"your\" people. If we are the same religion, we share rituals, we share motivations, we (should) share beliefs of what is \"right\" and \"wrong\". We feel secure because we are surrounded by like-minded individuals who, we like to think, would feel inclined or even obliged to help us out in times of personal or group crisis.\n\nAtheists either feel this need far less than the average person, or have very active intellects such the conclusions of their reasoning makes them feel very uncomfortable accepting the glaring contradictions of religion.\n\nTherefore the difference between the religious and the atheist has to do with feelings and is only indirectly related to intellect in as much as the intellect is capable of overriding emotions for any particular person. So you can easily find many strikingly intelligent persons who practice (if not truly believe) religion simply because, whether they admit it or not, they \"feel\" better doing so.\n\nThere are many atheists who do not realize this (I only truly realize this close to my 40s) and they waste much time trying to either convince someone via reasoning that religion makes no sense or they come to the conclusion that religious people simply lack the brain power to see the obvious contradictions. But, of course, reasoning cannot be used to change a person's position when reasoning had nothing to do with them having that position in the first place.\n\nAlso, the reason that religious people are upset or angry at atheists (and frequently, when religious people have the power, they treat them worse than people of distinctly different religion) is because they are upset that these people simply refuse to \"join\" with them. They seem them as people apart, persons who refuse to make a small (in their eyes) sacrifice (of reason) for the overall uniformity, harmony and \"good\" of the entire group - and this literally scares them (observe that most religious persons assume that atheists must be inherently immoral or amoral since they do not have a religious foundation - although all the evidence shows that atheists are far less likely to commit any kind of crime).\n\nYes humans can think, quite clearly when they want - but 99% of the time our decisions are made based on our emotions, not our thoughts. Usually our thoughts are retro justifications of our actions, which themselves are just reactions to our feelings.

The hypocrisy of the Christian church and the rules, regulations and worse, the laws that have imposed on the population because of religion have caused an atheistic back lash. While I think you have thrown the baby out with the bath water so to speak. I do not condemn you, and neither should any other Christian in my opinion. I see the new atheist movement as fighting for freedom from religiously fueled repression. If religion did not impact their lives I doubt the anti-theist movement would have any traction.\n\nHowever, when you call me, a theist, stupid just because I am a theist.
