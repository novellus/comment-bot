Period.  There is no debate, that is the ultimate law of the United States.\n\nYou will find that it was never intended that the federal government have the super-constitutional powers that it has today, including but not limited to: regulating drugs, food and education.  Again, *without passing judgment* on if those powers are desirable or not, they are not legal, and it would require a constitutional amendment to make them legal.\n\nWhether or not you agree with the intent of the constitution (which was to establish a very weak federal government uniting many smaller state which were effectively their own countries), you cannot ignore that it is the ultimate law of and basis for the government of the US.  A government based on the rule of law is only valid as long as it stays true to the laws enacted.  If it is not longer in the public interest to follow those laws, they must be changed, not ignored.\n\nYou might think that the *result* of Ron Paul's actions would be bad, but that it just your opinion.  Either way, you should be campaigning your government to legalize what you want (a strong fed) rather than attempting to undermine efforts to restore governmental legitimacy.\n\nIf you want to attack Ron Paul's policies, attack those which actual are legally questionable - such as the We the People act, not those of a senator with the integrity to uphold his oath to protect the constitution.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02a70z", "id": "c02a73l", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "politics", "name": "t1_c02a70z", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "ups": -4, "link_id": "t3_5yk2n", "retrieved_on": 1427425972, "id": "c02a70z", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c029tqv", "body": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": -6, "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": "1192847629", "children": [{"subreddit": "politics", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 1, "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": "1192847888", "children": [{"controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1427425972, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "archived": true, "name": "t1_c02a730", "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5yk2n", "downs": 0, "score": -5, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02a730", "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": "1192848379", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "politics", "ups": -5, "parent_id": "t1_c02a71q", "body": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "name": "t1_c02a71q", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 1, "link_id": "t3_5yk2n", "retrieved_on": 1427425972, "body": "I love the smell of ad-hominem in the morning.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02a716", "id": "c02a71q", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "politics", "ups": -6, "name": "t1_c02a716", "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5yk2n", "retrieved_on": 1427425972, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02a716", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c029tqv", "body": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "politics", "name": "t1_c029tqv", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 2, "link_id": "t3_5yk2n", "retrieved_on": 1427426144, "body": "The question of which politician to support is more a question of who is the least harmful, not so much the absolute ideology of the candidate.  \n\nRon Paul has a time tested and proven integrity and adherence to the ultimate law of this country - the constitution.  The only other candidates who exhibit such integrity -  or at least even claim to are Kucinich and Huckabee.\n\nEven if the bsalert.com 'expose' disproved libertarianism as a valid political theory (which it really doesn't, mostly it is just a series of ad-hominem attacks on libertarians, and broad claims that deregulation would lead to corporate driven anarchy).  However, this ignores the fundamental tenant of libertarianism, 'the right to my fist ends at your face'. \n\nFuther, addressing the real claims in the audio clip that claim that there is \"no evidence\" that such a governmental structure could work is not evidence that it cannot work (absence of evidence is not evidence of absence).  Until the early 1900's in the U.S. there was nearly no regulation and oversight at the federal level, but society didn't fall into ruin.\n\nLibertarian ideals do not mean that corporations have free reign, they still cannot pollute in ways that directly or indirectly affect others. Instead of government mandates, handed down by unelected bureaucrats, who are susceptible to influence by corporations anyway, corporations must police themselves, and people have to be intelligent, and politically willed enough to use their economic power to force corporations to act as they wish.\n\nFurther, in a deregulated system, anyone who is affected by a corporations pollution can just sue them in civil (or even criminal, if the pollution/actions were intentionally negligent) court, the citizens on a jury are not going to rule in favor of a corporation if that corporation is actively anti-citizen. That encourages corporations to a. not pollute, b. treat citizens well through market forces, without costly government intervention.\n\nThe fundamental problem with governmental regulation is that the consumer must pay twice for that regulation, once for the government to regulate corporations, and again for the corporations to abide by the arbitrary regulations devised by unelected bureaucrats.\n\nThe bottom line is that a Ron Paul presidency would be much less harmful to your wallet, your civil liberties and the  continued existence of this country than the neo-liberalism espoused by Hillary Clinton, or the near-fascist adherence to neo-conservatism which drives Rudy Guiliani's campaign.\n\nRemember, finally, that Ron Paul is only going to act at the federal level.  You could still choose to live in a state which would tax you up to your eyeballs (NY, or CA for example) but would provide more services (NY attorney general's office, CA environmental protection regulations), and your life wouldn't change all that much, except that you'd pay less taxes to the federal government to wage foreign wars for the interests of the military industrial complex, and to pay off the interest on the money that our government has to borrow from a private bank just to function.\n\nThere is no evidence provided by you, or bsalert.com, that Ron Paul is funded or encouraged by large corporations who are using him as a pawn, and it is inappropriate to undermine Ron Paul's integrity by doing so.  Further is it grossly inappropriate to use ad-hominem attacks in a political discussion, regardless of how little you respect the political theories of the opposition, or how funny you think it might be.  \n\nI cannot take you, or bsalert.com seriously, because you are not the voice of rationalism, you're the voice of obstructionism, rather than an honest discussion of issues and how we can improve the grossly flawed current political climate, you'd prefer ad-hominem attacks.
