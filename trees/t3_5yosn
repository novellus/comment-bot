Doesn't mean I can't conjecture that a properly designed study might find it.  (Gene*environment interactions are not *THAT* hard to study, but this would be a particularly difficult one to probe)\n\n&gt; that leads people to think that fiction affects reality far more than it actually does\n\nUmm, no.  I said that I suspect it may further preexisting violent tendencies through desensitization (though I was careful not to prejudge whether this is a significant component of the observed variation).  Show me a properly designed study, or even something resembling a properly designed study, that gives evidence supporting no detectable/clinically significant departures from random variation after controlling for other confounding factors, and I'll happily pitch any claim to significance in the dustbin.\n\n&gt; far more than it actually does\n\nHere's an ironic note: you mention the lack of a baseline measurement in the studies with which you disagree, but you do not seem to provide one in your own discourse.  I can understand your indignation at people saying a 2-foot-tall structure is really 200 feet tall -- but you're not providing the 'true' measurement.  Claiming the null is not unreasonable, but please be explicit.\n\n&gt; The extremely low level of exposure to actual violence (that'd be the kind with real people, not actors and corn syrup or red pixels) in our society leads to a degradation of respect for it and an equivocation between simulated violence and real violence which does not exist in reality\n\nSo how does this jive with the children who grew up in Sierra Leone during the war, or those growing up in Baghdad or Palestine now?  You'd think they'd have plenty of exposure to real live violence, but your converse notion that this engenders respect for the real thing doesn't seem to pan out.

Our behavior stems from a network of millions of neurons processing the world in parallel, and every single one of those networks is entirely different.  The input they are processing is entirely different.  The experiments done thus far into this area have been very blunt and dumb.  They test the stimulation of the amygdula after playing a violent videogame and after playing a 'nonviolent' videogame.  They don't even bother having the people act in a violent play, or witness real violence, etc.  Or they test reactions to violent videos after they have played violent videogames and think that somehow the 'video' part drops out of the equation and they can equate it to reactions to actual violence.

Most of them draw conclusions that are quite irrelevant (such as the one where people play violent videogames and then react differently to violent videos where they are not exposed to other forms of violent fiction, no baseline before playing the games is ever taken, and they are only tested a single time with a small sample size immediately after playing the games) and then simply extrapolate them far beyond what is reasonable.

It's the parents who fail to provide any other acclimatization to civil society.  As Tremblay notes, children without sufficient communication skills are more prone to become frustrated and violent when they don't get what they want.\n\nI suspect that individuals who are (genetically) prone to aggression can have their tendencies furthered by desensitization to violent acts, and this study does nothing to refute that; this would be a classic example of nature*nurture interaction if it turns out to be the case.  Stalin didn't have teevee to shape him.\n\nNo matter what a parent does, some children will turn out to be monsters; and in spite of the worst parenting imaginable, some kids from 'bad' homes will turn out very well.

That's great, but I have never seen a 100% accurate predictor in a clinical setting, and whatever variance in outcome is not accounted for by prenatal environment and/or genotype might well turn out to have a childhood environmental component.\n\nIf environment were wholly unimportant after childhood, PTSD would never be reported in adults.

Advertising first.  There are several aspects to advertising.  On one front, advertising is a nonfiction information-bearing medium.  How do you find out about new products?  You can find out through word of mouth or stumbling upon the things in a store, etc.  A much more effective method from the point of view of the producers of products, though, is to simply tell you about the product directly.  Now, when dealing with something like Coke, which has already reached a very high level of market saturation and has been elevated by society from simply a product to a part of culture, advertising serves a different purpose.  Continued advertising by Coke helps keep it current.  By continuing to participate in the culture and convey that they are not letting their product grow old and stale, they can maintain the impression that they are invested in the growing culture and are growing along with it.  Coke doesn't simply continue advertising, it continues to produce NEW advertising.  \n\nNow propaganda.  Have you seen propaganda?  Have you noticed that propaganda does not consist of the same things as violent media?  Propaganda isn't violent videogames, movies, plays, etc.  Propaganda makes an argument and addresses the audience directly, not through fiction, but through deception.  It claims to be the truth, and it claims to be nonfiction.  It does as much as possible to establish itself as trustworthy to the audience it is geared towards.  It then tries to present an argument to the audience to justify violence.  It doesn't work otherwise.  People didn't start eating babies when Swift published \"A Modest Proposal\".  You can't simply recommend violence and then see violence happen.  Most people have a natural propensity to avoid violence and you can't incite them to harm other people and put themselves at risk simply by showing them a fictional character having fun doing it.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "name": "t1_c02ade2", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 2, "link_id": "t3_5yosn", "retrieved_on": 1427425890, "body": "[deleted]", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02a4on", "id": "c02ade2", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 31, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5yosn", "retrieved_on": 1427426003, "body": "We have long since passed the point at which people should be able to realize that fiction is not harmful.

It does not take a novel insight to spot the historical pattern and see that the principles underlying the claims have been thoroughly disproven.\r\n\r\nFor instance, people blame videogames for violence.  They say that videogames are more 'interactive' and involve the player moreso than previous mediums.  These people have intentionally not though about the issue.  If they had, even a short review of other mediums would have turned up plays and movies and television shows and even radio dramas in which people regularly interact in the stories in a MUCH more direct way than videogames are able to convey.  \r\n\r\nTelevision is more influential because it is visual?  Why don't we ever ask for proof of this claim?  Common sense is not a compliment, it is an insult.  It is meant to mean 'sense of the commoners' and should not be revered.  It should always be questioned and never trusted without proof.\r\n\r\nTelevision doesn't make kids violent or lecherous or mischievous.  Neither do comic books.  Nor do videogames.  Nor do books.
