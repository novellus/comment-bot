This story is one example -- it is criticizing a firm that is protected by law from the incursion of the larger insurance firms.  Here is the money quote:\n\n&gt; In all but a handful of states, laws bar insurance giants in other fields, such as AIG or State Farm, from offering title insurance and undercutting incumbents' prices.\n\nYou will not find much pointed criticism in Forbes of the big firms though like AIG, CitiGroup, MerillLynch, etc.  These big firms are worshiped by Forbes even though their profits are larger, and their culpability in major financial incidents like the SubPrime issue and bailout are larger.\n\nThis story is just one example.
