That is far too crazy. Why do corrupt people want a perpetual all-seeing government? They don't really. They want money, siphon it from the public treasury by either privatizing this or that, then get the fuck out of there. They aren't particularly creative or clever or far-reaching. Jones gives these neocons far too much credit.  Its about theft, plain and simple. Anyways, Jones does give a good talk in this video. When Jones sticks to history, he's dead-bang-on the money. When he makes new stuff up, its not a sure shot.", "author": "rook2pawn", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c02b5wc", "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "name": "t1_c02b5wc", "parent_id": "t3_5z1a0", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}
