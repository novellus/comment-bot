We must continue the comprehensive approach that has resulted in the development of a national counter-terrorism strategy involving all arms and levels of our government. We must continue to target terrorist finances, break up support cells, and disrupt training. And we must close avenues of cyber-attack by improving the security of the Internet and the computers upon which our digital economy exists.*\n\n*As President, Al Gore will tolerate no attack against American interests at home or abroad: terrorists must know that if they attack America, we will never forget. We will scour the world to hunt them down and bring them to justice.*\n\n*While fighting terrorism, we will protect the civil liberties of all Americans. Our justice system must guarantee fairness with procedures that protect the rights of the accused, even under the unusual circumstances of the investigation of threats to our national security. We must avoid stereotyping, for it defeats the highest purposes of our country if citizens feel automatically suspect by virtue of their ethnic origin.

It is based on an in-depth analysis of the facts and context.\n\nDo i believe the Republican Party would let the SCOTUS, against all precedent and with no basis in the Constitution, stop the vote count in a state and install a President? Yes i do. It does not matter what that makes ME, because that is what ACTUALLY HAPPENED. Furthermore, it's not like the Republican Party has a good record these days of standing up to their own members when those members are behaving illegally, immorally, or unconstitutionally.\n\nIf the vote counts were stopped then how, precisely, did Bush get elected President? Hell, the article we're ostensibly discussing put it best: The decision says that Bush wins even if Gore gets the most votes. This is not \"inferring intent\". What they actually did was separate from their intent and requires no divination at all.\n\nYou seem to have a hard time discerning between opinion, facts, and claims though so let me give you my OPINION:\n\nThe decision was a politically motivated and the kindest thing i can think of to say about it was that it was a terrible mistake that has thrown the whole country into a new, darkened age. \n\nI feel fairly justified in saying this, although it is somewhat tenuous. At least one Justice, Sandra Day O Conner, explicitly said she wanted a Republican President so she could retire and get a politically similar replacement. At least one of the nine Justices threatened to resign from the Court in protest over the horribleness of this decision, only staying on out of fear of Bush's potential replacement. (A fear which has been, as far as i can tell, well-justified.)\n\nI suspect this opinion will have far-reaching ramifications that we cannot, now, begin to suspect. I've already said here that this is most likely going to be the single most important case of the 20th century.\n\nI, furthermore, think that some dumb fucks on the internet who don't understand the decision, don't care to understand, and continuously try to argue the person when they cannot argue the facts are not worth my time. Yet i feel compelled to make my case so that such nonsense does not go unchallenged.\n\nI do not care what you, or some other scum-sucking forum troll, thinks of me. I have little to no respect for your formulaic sophistry. I've seen it before and i'll see it again, but mere repetition of argument is not enough to convince me one way or the other.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02bjej", "parent_id": "t1_c02bj0d", "id": "c02bjej", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "politics", "ups": -1, "name": "t1_c02bj0d", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5yj84", "retrieved_on": 1427425279, "score_hidden": false, "body": "&gt;&gt;\"Rank treachery is not my opinion.

I agree that was badly worded and I admit I posted that in haste.  In American Holocaust, the author Stannard estimates the total cost of the near-extermination of the American Indians as 100,000,000.\n\nNow how much of that actually is the result of the United States is hard to say.  I was wrong to say this country was responsible for 90%. But there is no denying that the US did seek to exterminate Native Americans by bullets, relocation, exposure to disease (intentional exposure such as blankets infected with small pox), and the inhuman conditions they were forced to live in.  Not to mention those killed by settlers moving West seeking land and religious freedom; or those killed as a result of racism.  \n\n&gt; Until you can post some facts on those numbers you are making shit up.\n\nBut there lies the problem.  There is no historical data about how many inhabitants actually lived at that time period.  There are numerous estimates but they vary greatly unfortunately.  We will never have an exact answer on that.  It can\u2019t be proven on paper... it must have never happened?   \n\n&gt; While there was fighting on both sides, the vast majority of Native Americans died of disease not bullets.\n\nSome argue that those numbers should be included in the total as stated in the following: \n\n&gt;  David Stannard, for instance, states that just as Jews who died of disease and starvation in the ghettos are counted among the victims of the Holocaust, Indians who died of introduced diseases \"were as much the victims of the Euro-American genocidal war as were those burned or stabbed or hacked or shot to death, or devoured by hungry dogs.\" As an example of actual genocidal conditions, Stannard points to Franciscan missions in California as \"furnaces of death.\" \nhttp://hnn.us/articles/7302.html \n\nAnd even if you don\u2019t include those numbers you can\u2019t discredit the policies of the United States and its people that actively worked to eliminate American Indians.  \n\nThe fact remains that the current Native American population of the United States is less than 1%.  Far below other ethnic groups within the United States.   \nCensus 2000 quickfacts: http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html\n\n&gt; At last look America was not colonizing Iraq so your post ends making even less sense than at the start.\n\nThe US may not be looking to colonize Iraq but the person I was responding to was talking about the 600k Iraqis that have died as a result of the war.

My prof was a quasi-fascist, card-carrying member of the Heritage Foundation and was quietly (and viciously) gleeful at the decision. His response was something along the lines of \"finally those robed imbeciles found the courage to install a Republican against the wishes of the American people.\" Not that directly and not that succinctly, but that was the response.\n\nMuch like you and your professor, i lost faith in political science. It cannot answer questions, solve problems, or in any way help us. It is not even benign, but potentially dangerous: it gives the tools of deception and control to madmen.\n\nI was never looking to become a Political Science major (Computer Science for me) but i will have no connection to it, now.\n\nThat is a side point, however.\n\nI had a moment just a year or two ago where i ran into someone who was 8 when Bush was elected and has known nothing but Bush. He grasped something was wrong, but could not understand it. For the first time i realized a whole generation of people were growing up under a malfunctioning, psychotic, and dangerous government and did not know anything else. I can't exactly describe the feeling, but it must be something like suddenly finding out a whole class of people--who live in the same place you do and by and large in the same manner--had never met someone of the opposite sex. Not that they were virgins, but that they only knew of such people through stories and myth. Except replace \"the opposite sex\" with \"freedom\" and \"justice\". How can someone be an American citizen if they do not know what a real American government looks like? How can we ever undo the damage caused by Bush if a substantial number of people out there don't know what the undamaged model looks like?\n\nThe part that shocks me most of all, however, is the decision itself and the response to it. I remember when it was handed down i didn't really understand the Court or the workings of judicial decisions. (And it seemed then that nobody really did and that it was sort of something beyond the grasp of lay people, only scrutable by scholars and lawyers.) I assumed, and i am not now sure why, the decision was defensible: an extreme and unprecedented decision, but one with the backing of the law somehow. I did not bother to read the decision and would not have understood it then anyway, most likely. However: a few years later i did read and (i think) understand the decision and was shocked by it. \"How could that possibly be right,\" i thought to myself. I thought i was misunderstanding something for sure so i went and searched out books, other legal views, and so on and found that they mostly confirmed by views--the dissenters being mostly the work of Republicans, either lying about the decision or the work of psychopaths attempting to defend the indefensible.\n\nBut that wasn't the most shocking thing. I still couldn't believe the Supreme Court--and i mean, this is the SUPREME Court--could get this so wrong. So i began asking other people about the decision. People whose views i respected despite the fact that they were not scholars or professionals. None of them had read it, and when i tried to explain it they refused to believe me AND they refused to go read the decision themselves! They were as shocked as i was at the idea, yet they responded to the shock by just ignoring it--to varying degrees of severity.\n\nAt one point, just to see how he would react, i suggested to my father that Bush v. Gore was the most important decision of the 20th century. I think it MAY be that, but time will tell. Anyway, he argued it wasn't important at all and that the most important decision had to be something along the lines of Roe v. Wade or school desegregation or something like that. I couldn't even get him to conditionally agree--that it WOULD be the most important IF the Court had, along partisan lines, thrown out a vote because their man was going to lose and instead simply declared him President.\n\nIt is sobering to think about.

I was a 19-year old freshman majoring in political science when this went down, so here's what it was like to go through the fall of 2000.\n\nTerrible.\n\nWhen the election came around, I voted, casting my first vote for Gore, naturally.  As a political junkie, I watched the returns come in (exit polls) all through the night and into the morning, by which time the election in Florida was in dispute and a winner could not be declared.\n\nOver the remainder of November and early December, the media focused on the fact that there was no president at that time, as if getting to inauguration without a president would have meant the end of the world.  There was near-hysteria over this fact.  \n\nI remember when the Florida Supreme Court decision came down, because it looked like a huge win for democracy and the rule of law.  The announcement was made on the steps of the court building by a herald to a massive throng of Gore supporters, and I think everyone at that point thought Gore would win.  \n\nThen, over the next few days, there were images of the \"Brooks Brothers\" riots in the polling places, where Bush supporters tried to intimidate polling officials by occupying offices and screaming and shouting, ostensibly challenging every vote so as to gum up the system.  This was eerie, because there were no Gore supporters engaged in such actions and there were no police removing these demonstrators.  In retrospect, I think I was probably witnessing the coup that would have occurred if SCOTUS hadn't stepped in and done it for them.  The media reported images of this, but didn't explain what was happening, nor did they explain that it was only Bush \"supporters\" (hired hands, who now can be found littering all corners of his administration) engaging in this type of action.\n\nWhen SCOTUS accepted the case, there was total acceptance by the MSM.  By that point, the media was in hysterics about \"legitimacy\" and the idea that the next president must be seen as legitimate.  This was presented as the paramount issue at hand, far more important than who the person who actually took office was.\n\nThe arguments were heard live but without video, as per Supreme Court custom.  I think everyone expected the court to be unanimous in its decision; a split along party lines was not widely predicted.  When the decision came down, it was printed in the Supreme Court building and then handed out to reporters, who ran out furiously flipping pages and trying to make sense of the convoluted decision while on the air.  This led to some confusion and I didn't really understand what the decision was until the next day or so.\n\nAt the next meeting of my survey poli sci class, my usually upbeat professor was crestfallen.  He told us that the decision had put him in a personal crisis and that he felt as if the study of political science had been a waste of his life.  He mentioned leaving academia and implied that studying for the PhD in poli sci was a waste of time when the rule of law didn't apply.  At the time, I remember thinking that he was being extreme, that the decision couldn't possibly mean that much. But then, during the course of my education, I slowly realized that he was absolutely right; Bush v. Gore was the moment when politics became marketing.  The decision was the worst possible because it symbolically divided the country along partisan lines, a divide which grew exponentially over the ensuing years.  While the Clinton administration was a partisan era, it was not at all like what you see today.  The personal animosity wasn't there and where it was, it was considered extreme.  I went to a very conservative school with classrooms full of loud-mouthed Republicans (the worst kind in any political science class) and, while I was bemused by them in my freshman year, I was bitterly resentful of them by the time I graduated in 04.  \n\nI suppose it was a mildly interesting time to be in college--the Great Selection of 2000, September 11th, the Iraq War \"Debate\" and War, The Mission Accomplished Landing (which I remember explicitly), the Purple Fingered Iraqis casting their first votes.  It was a weird time of ultra-patriotic bombast and political correctness, especially after September 11th.  In sum, I would say it was an interesting time because the Republic died and went into decline in a single instant and it was cheered on by everyone who didn't know any better.  By 2004, those of us who did know what was happening thought it would all turn around in November, but of course, we were wrong and 2005 was definitely the most depressing, terrible year I can remember.  2006 was worse still and now in 2007 it seems as if everything is starting to fall apart.\n\nI think, judging from what I just wrote, that Bush v. Gore can only be understood by viewing the decision retrospectively.  For those who, like myself, were young men deeply interested in politics and coming of age in the new century, the case defined the years that would follow in an entirely negative way.  For any intellectual, these were the equivalent of very dark years:  debate was suppressed, wars began seemingly without cause or based on obvious lies, photo-ops and media stunts replaced debate and progress with nonsensical Orwellian doublespeak, etc.  We saw the rise of political satire at the same time the MSM became more celebutante-centric and more focused on electioneering and punditry.\n\nMost people will say that the 90s was a different time in a way they can't describe.  But someone with a deep interest in politics or culture will tell you that Bush v. Gore was the seminal moment when everything slid into sad, pathetic decline.

I wrote it on December 13, 2000, the day after the decision came down. My goal as a constitutional lawyer was to explain the decision in all its glorious self-contradiction and nonsensical and political nature. \r\n\r\nIf you don't understand the opinion, then you are a rational normal human being. If you DO understand the opinion, you need mental help. There is not a single law professor in the country--and this little Q&amp;A is taught in at least four law schools now--that can justify the decision because it contradicts itself. That's thee beauty of it. It has zero basis in law (in fact, in contradicts all prior law on the matter) but it claims to be legal, and because most Americans are not constitutional lawyers, they don't realize that the \"emperor has no clothes\", i.e. that the opinion is, how can I put this nicely, hmmm...ok, I can't...\"bullshit with a bowtie.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever you think of the Bush presidency, it should be clear that this little coup d'etat by the Supreme Court changed history forever and ended the rule of law in America. That's why no one blinks an eye any more as we round up innocent people and hold them without charges or access to attorneys and torture them in secret prisons in foreign countries while hiding them from the Red Cross.\r\n\r\nEveryone seems to blame the disrespect for the rule of law and the Constitution in America on Bush, but Bush is a CREATION of the Supreme Court. He could not have \"won\" the Great Selection of 2000 if they had not been willing to throw the law and the Constitution out of the window in order to do their own coup d'etat. Which is why I advocated at that time that we keep our courts free of Bush judges until we have a free election. After all, it's one awful thing for the US Supreme Court to appoint the President and quite another for them to appoint 1000s of new judges via their appointed President (as they now have done).\r\n\r\nAnyway, thank you, \"rook2pawn\" for reposting it here.

Following this decision, I became so radicalized (I didn't think coup d'etats happened in America) that I wrote the brief challenging the Florida Electors for the Congressional Black Caucus (that's on mediasense as well and was featured in Fahrenheit 9/11) and then moved to Washington to become an attorney in Congress.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I host a daily radio and television show called \"The Inside Scoop.\"  You can hear the show, live and archived, audio and video, at RadioInsideScoop.com.\r\n\r\nIf you like what I wrote, check out my radio show.
