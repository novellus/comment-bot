Different projects have different goals in mind, and what one developer considers to be a runaway success, another might consider to be an utter failure.\n\nFor instance, is Microsoft's Visual SourceSafe a success? Well, it probably generates a profit for Microsoft, but if it's goal is to keep source files safe, as it's name would suggest, it's track record is shockingly poor. VSS appears to have been developed by some of the most incompetent developers ever to touch a mouse, and is widely regarded as the worst commercial VCS solution ever sold on the mass market.\n\nOn the other hand, is Git a success? It certainly doesn't generate a profit, and has a userbase only a fraction the size of VSS. Nevertheless, it certainly succeeds in keeping source files safer than VSS, and operates very well as the main VCS for the Linux kernel.
