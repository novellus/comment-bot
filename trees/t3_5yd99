The feedback form doesn't seem to work, I click \"send\" and nothing happens.  I've filled in the form correctly.  Also, the captcha image is really hard to read.\n\n2. The preference: \"display links with a reddit toolbar\" doesn't seem to work for me anymore.  Links just open directly.  I've tried saving the preferences but that didn't help.\n\nI'm using Firefox Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.7) Gecko/20070914 Firefox/2.0.0.7.  Javascript is enabled.\n\nThanks.", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5yd99", "id": "c029dt0", "author_flair_css_class": null}
