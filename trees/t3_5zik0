I make no claims of perfection, but I had no wish to get divorced, and I busted my butt to try to make things better. She just would not put anything into the marriage. 17 yrs and 2 kids.

It doesn't matter what it is, but she will be grasping at straws to get me to fix her feelings.  She will probably also go shopping/cut her hair/go on a diet, etc... at the same time, not knowing the cause.  Eventually she will become demanding enough that I will curtail my attempts to change any further because I recognize the pattern.  She will then leave eventually, citing her reason for leaving as that she was \"unhappy in the relationship.\"  The fact of the matter is, her unhappiness has nothing to do with relationships.  She is unhealthy emotionally, and has not yet learned how to deal with her own states of feeling.  She believes it is the relationships making her happy or unhappy because the initial thrill of falling in love masks her symptoms for a short time.

Happiness comes from within, not from external circumstances. \"I wasn't happy\" is a tell that the previous relationship was a dependent one, and she was relying on the former partner to prop her up.\r\n\r\nI agree with all of that *except* the middle bit.  Happiness quite certainly is affected by external circumstances, although a larger component is the psychology of the person experiencing them.  \r\n\r\nBut it's quite wrong to suggest that circumstances play no part.  (And quite unfortunate that people need to dualize it into either/or, rather than acknowledging the complexity of the relationship between circumstances and personal psychology.)\r\n\r\nThe reason I'd be skittish of anyone who says they \"weren't happy\" is because if there were something definite in the circumstances, they wouldn't have to resort to the vague \"not happy\".  I think that choice of phrase does *strongly* suggest what you've listed, and that it's their psychology more than a specific problem in the circumstances.  \r\n\r\nBut it's not that circumstances don't affect happiness, for heaven's sake.  If someone ends a relationship because their partner cheated, that's a rather valid circumstance for affecting their happiness.  In that case they'd be able to say \"he cheated on me\" rather than \"I wasn't happy\".  And if it's something they just don't want to name, hopefully they can at least hint at it, to let you know that it was something(s) specific that happened, and not just their own attitude about the relationship changing.  \r\n\r\nI can imagine some narrow range of circumstances where a person would say \"I wasn't happy\" and it's actually a specific thing(s) that changed within the relationship, which *anybody* would sympathize with, if they knew about.  \r\n\r\nBut purely based on experience, \"I wasn't happy\" is far more likely to suggest someone who will find a way to not be happy in most relationships after a bit of time has passed.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "ups": 64, "name": "t1_c02cegm", "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5zik0", "retrieved_on": 1427424872, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02cegm", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5zik0", "body": "As a divorced man in his 40's with kids, I can see this guy's point of view pretty well.  I was married for 12 years, 15+ year relationship.  There was no question that both of us were committed to the relationship and worked hard at it.  However, it was clear to me 2 years before the end that she had already divorced me emotionally, and we spent a year in counseling and patch up efforts like \"if you do this for me things will improve\" before she could face that fact within herself, and I could finally say that nothing I was going to do was going to change the fact that she didn't love me any more, and she had to accept that certain aspects of my character were not going to change.\n\nHis rule number is actually a pretty good rule.  Happiness comes from within, not from external circumstances.  \"I wasn't happy\" is a tell that the previous relationship was a dependent one, and she was relying on the former partner to prop her up.  Believe me, after you've been through this kind of disintegration, you gain a highly attuned set of hot buttons for statements like that.  His justifications for his reasoning may not be entirely supportable, but that's not the point.  He's got the instinct backed by experience to tell him when something isn't going to work, so he's got to rely on that.\n\nWhat's funny about relationships is that character *can* change, once you get out of an emotionally sapping situation.  Both I and my children's mother are better parents and better people now, and we have a better relationship than previously in this millennium.\n\nHowever, I agree with the other comments that this guy has some stuff to work through.  First off, I'm not sure Craigslist is a very good place to look for a new relationship.  Second, you can't fault an environment for not being accepting of who you are.  If you truly accept yourself, you'll find a better place to meet people.  Finally, if you feel like you have to defend yourself from attitudes that aren't really directed at you, you have to ask yourself what it is you're really trying to defend.  I.e., why does he have to justify anything?\n\nMy own rules for dating:\n\n1) Avoid people who show selfish, critical, contemptuous, defensive or overly rigid attitudes.  Seek people who are positive and optimistic.  Remember the 80/20 rule:  At least 80% of your interactions with the person should be positive.  Do they keep the ball rolling?  Roll with the punches?  Do you have a humorous and witty banter together that keys off earlier topics of conversation?  You want to be with someone who listens to you and you enjoy listening to, instead of stepping on everything you say, always drawing the topic back to themselves.\n\n2) Avoid emotionally dependent or insecure people.  You should each have your own worlds to share with each other.\n\n3) Do you admire and respect each other?  Are you each willing to be influenced by the other's judgement?  If not, there's a power imbalance.\n\n4) Chemistry :-).\n", "author_flair_css_class": null}
