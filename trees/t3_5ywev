First, are the Pols who do exactly what they are told to do by \"The Lobby\" as quickly and enthusiastically as possible--Rudi, Hilary, all \"First Tier\" Presidential Candidates and almost all other heavy hitters in Congress. Second, are the Pols who WILL obey AIPAC as soon as they become powerful enough to be \"recruited\" by \"The Lobby\". And, finally, a frighteningly tiny group of incredibly fearless and classically patriotic American politicians who have received their \"orders\" from AIPAC, but have told the lobby to go fuck themselves. This final, tiny, group is a very endangered species indeed. If you find one do everything to protect and nurture him or her because it, most probably, will be our last chance to avoid WWIII.
