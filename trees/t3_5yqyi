It's like hating the scorpion for stinging, it's just his nature.  But Pelosi has gotten to her position of power and promptly used it to sell out the entire Democratic party.\r\n\r\nI'd call her an Uncle Tom, if such a thing were allowed any more.\r\n\r\nShe has all the spine of a jellyfish and is, in my estimation, currently well on the way to destroying the Democrats' chances in 2008.  ALL she had to do was manage to be less pathetically reprehensible than the Republicans, and so far she's failing.
