Bush had Condi write his back in 2000\r\n\r\nWell, ya know, being *The Decider* and all doesn't mean he should be expected to be able to actually construct a sentence or write an opinion, or even come up with ideas, he just *decides* things, just as soon as he gets the memo from God. \r\n\r\nActually, I wish I would've seen that Condi piece back in 2000. I realize it was written about foreign policy, for Foreign Affairs, but the very fact that it starts right off saying: \"The United States has found it exceedingly difficult to define its \"national interest\" in the absence of Soviet power\", should've been one hell of a tip-off that whatever else was coming was going to be a way to put the military industrial complex back into the profit mode. The whole idea of a nation defining itself in terms of it's enemies is ridiculous, absurd and frightening. It's as if there were no other concerns both at home and abroad. \r\n\r\nThat \"Condi\" essay reads like it came directly from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), or the Project for the New American Century (PNAC). It's a neocon wetdream. I'd be willing to bet that Paul Wolfowitz had a hand in it.
