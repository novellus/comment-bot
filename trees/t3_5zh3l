Which does not mean that Google doesn't play pagerank tricks, especially political ones.  It is well-known that they adjust the pagerank in obscure ways to remove linkfarms etc.  I don't know if they politically manipulate their rankings.\n\nAnyway, searching for www.foxnews.com yields 128e6 results, link:www.foxnews.com yields 32400, a link ratio of 2.53e-4.  Whereas for Alex Jones the ratio is 7.6e-3.  Hence, by the flawed logic of this stupid rant, Google boosts paranoid conspiracy sites by a factor of 10.\n\n", "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": "t3_5zh3l", "ups": 2, "author_flair_css_class": null}
