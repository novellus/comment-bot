Nothing pisses me off more than racing games where, given the same car and the same opponents on the same track, if you win, it's always by approximately the same margin (i.e., when you drive better, the opponents magically get better too, so the only indication that your skills are improving is faster lap times.)  \n\nThat's one of the things I love about Gran Turismo, and it generalizes to all kinds of games (for instance, RPG's where all the monsters in the world dynamically toughen up along with your character - the only way you improve your character in any meaningful way is by collecting better gear, and so it's no more an RPG than Super Mario Bros. 3).  \n\nCan you imagine what a colossal failure DDR would have been if it dynamically added steps based on your performance, so that no matter what song you picked or what your skill level was, 'perfect' was always damn-near impossible, but a B was pretty much achievable by anyone on any song?
