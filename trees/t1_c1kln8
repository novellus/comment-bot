No reason for the report is requested and no evidence is asked for. This means individuals can take out their own prejudices on others by reporting anyone they disagree with. Also it can appear that your post has gone through when it hasn't. It shows up in the users list of posts but no one else sees it. It is very deceptive and dishonest to do it that way. And if you are reported you are not asked to defend yourself. In fact you aren't even told you've been reported and may not even know that this happened.  It is very authoritarian since it allows any disgruntled user to ban what the rest of us read.
