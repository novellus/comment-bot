This is the only person on this story so far who has accurately described the law.\n\nThe key word is \"tender.\" Cash is legal \"tender.\" Tender in this case is a term that refers to offering and handing over something. For example, \"I tender the witness.\"\n\nWhat legal tender means is this: \n\nIf you owe someone money and you tender them something that is legal tender (e.g., cash) then they have to take it. If they choose not to take it, that's not your problem--they can no longer sue you to collect the debt!\n\nBut that only applies to debts you already have. If you don't YET owe someone money they are perfectly free to refuse to deal with anyone they want to.\n\nIn fact, legal tender doesn't even apply to most transactions in everyday life since vendors usually require you to pay upfront--so you never have any time to become a debtor anyway (Although restaurants might be one common exception--I guess you could legally carry around pennies and pay your bill in them--but it wouldn't be much use, because Olive Garden probably wouldn't sue to collect your $30 bill anyway if you ran out without paying)\n\n\n\nIncidentally, this quote on that same treasury page is insightful: \n\n\"In another sense, because they are legal tender, Federal Reserve notes are \"backed\" by all the goods and services in the economy.\"\n\nThis is an interesting point. It's true that cash is not backed by any specific material like gold. If it were backed by say, gold, you'd know if you have a dollar that you can go to the treasury and get some gold for it. But that does not mean that our system is entirely based on trust. \n\nBecause of legal tender, if you have a dollar, you know that any debt you have can be paid off with it and that the court systems of the united states will back you on it. For that matter, anyone's debts have that property, and there's a lot of debts out there. So in a sense the dollar is backed by the power of our judicial system (which is pretty powerful compared to say, anarchy) and its ability to declare some liabilities valid and some invalid.", "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": "1193640321", "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 9, "parent_id": "t1_c02bwfu", "id": "c02bwwt", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1427425085, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "created_utc": "1193663577", "ups": 1, "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5zbex", "downs": 0, "score": 1, "body": "No, they don't have to accept cash for \"transactions\" just \"debts\"", "id": "c02bxzr", "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "archived": true, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "name": "t1_c02bxzr", "parent_id": "t1_c02bwfu", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 7, "name": "t1_c02bwfu", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5zbex", "retrieved_on": 1427425105, "score_hidden": false, "body": "I believe they have to accept cash for transactions, but they can opt for a different form of payment.
