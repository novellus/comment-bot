However, what we DO know is this:\n\nThe game features Roxas during the time period of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories after Sora entered a deep sleep. The game will explore the time from Roxas's creation until his confrontation with Riku that leads to his placement in the data-based Twilight Town in Kingdom Hearts II. It is said to be in full 3D as a single and multiplayer game. Cooperative multiplayer was one feature on display at the 2007 Tokyo Game Show demonstrating that players can work together, in addition to the traditional use of AI controlled partners. Multiplayer gameplay is speculated to control Roxas and other members of Organization XIII.\n\nSo far, Xigbar, Saix, Roxas, and Axel have been confirmed as playable characters, although it is speculated that all members of Organization XIII will be available to be played. The video also shows off a mysterious \"14th member\" of the organization, who is a female, but her face is concealed by the trademark Organization hood.\n\nThat's about all that's known right now, but it's enough to get one quite excited already. More then likely, we won't see this game until late 2008, but there is no release date. But come on, being able to play as the Organization members in a fully action-based RPG on the DS? Sounds amazing to me.\n\nhttp://www.nsider2.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=3272", "author_flair_css_class": null}
