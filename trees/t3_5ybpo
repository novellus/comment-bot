This article is extremely poorly written, *not* thought invoking, and entirely misrepresents the idea of stopping time.  Here is a little exert to show what i mean:\n\n&gt;What superpower would I have? Immediately the first thing that came to mind was the ability to pause time, similar to the Japanese guy in Heroes. Can you imagine how great it would be to have that superpower? I could potentially stay in bed for hours, press play when I wanted to go to work and pause time again for an extended three hours lunch break. More importantly, I could rob banks and make myself filthy rich and never have to work again. Nobody would see me. I could even be a good Samaritan and pause time as someone was about to get hit by a car, dive heroically pushing them out of the way and save them from certain death.\n\n&gt;However, being the nerd that I am I started to see the shortcomings in this superpower. It would mess up my body clock. The world would think its 8am and my body would think it is 11am. I would start to fall asleep at 7pm or 8pm. That wouldn\u2019t be much fun especially if I was planning a night out away from my computer screen. Perhaps a night in front of the TV instead.\n\n&gt;Secondly, if I pause time, will it just be people who pause or will machines pause as well? Will the CCTV keep running as I rob Chase Manhattan Bank for the second time? If machines pause as well, will that mean that the electrons that power my electricity will stop spinning?\n\n&gt;I would no longer be able to spend countless hours on Facebook, Reddit and You Tube. My BitTorrent downloads would cease! Oh the pain! It was time to find a new superpower as I twisted and turned in my bed.\n\nStopping time.  How would this mess with your biological clock?  stop time again and get a full nights rest, fuck around until your perceived time matches up with the actual time, and then start time again.  not a hard concept.  Also, of course machines would stop too.  Stopping time is not the same as stopping people; everything ceases to move (including those little electrons and shit that power this fag's computer, so i guess he can't fucking poke people on facebook).  When you would start time, it would be as if it was never stopped, so electronics wouldn't shut down.\n\nThe part of this superpower that gets me is vision.  Our eyes capture and interpret reflected light into images.  If light stops moving, how would we see?\n\nneedless to say, this article got a downmod from me.
