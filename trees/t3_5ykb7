I believe more people than in most other countries believe that you can forfeit (some or all) rights by your own actions.  Obviously, small wrong-doing will entail losses/constraints of minor rights, capital crimes will cost you major rights. This is not unreasonable, and rather logical for a society which, to admirable success, always built on the individual as his own fate-builder, and favored the idea idea of \"paying the price\".  \n\nNow take a look at children imprisonment.

However, unless we find a very strong argument why children are, not gradually, but fundamentally, different from adults, there is no reason why their rights can not be forfeited; since they are stronger in some sense, it would take more wrong-doing than for adults, but the principle should be the same.  \n\nObviously, it is not a good idea to lock down kids, if for no other reason then because it will inevitably hurt a nation's soul to have children behind bars.
