A highlight of the paper, for me, was the contorted plot of said parameter as a function of scale, and the accompanying text that said (and I paraphrase here) \"Now all we have to do is find a rationale and a functional form for this plot.\"\n\nSincerely, it's nice to see people examining the alternatives.  But for the time being, I find it easier to believe that the universe contains particles that have no charge, and whose constituents (if any) have no charge, than to justify MOG as I understand it.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
