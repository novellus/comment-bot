You could argue that this provision does nothing - schools have traditionally provided public forums for students to speak. It does say that these forums are \"limited\" - but schools can regulate free speech if it is disruptive, as Tinker vs Des Moines stipulates. So, again nothing new. What harm is there if this provision merely rehashes existing statutes and judicial decisions? Again, there is no violation, because these are public forums, extricating the school and thus preventing a violation of the Establishment clause.\n\n&gt; (c) Student expression concerning \n&gt; permissible subjects/topics, as determined \n&gt; by school district policy, may not\n&gt; be excluded on the basis that the \n&gt; subject/topic is expressed from a\n&gt; religious viewpoint.\n\nHow do your arguments apply to *this* provision? You could argue that this provision does nothing. Tinker vs Des Moines stipulates that school districts can set policies restricting student expression if that content is disruptive. This provision states that expression cannot be excluded *solely* on the basis that it is religious. But, again this rehashes existing laws and judicial decisions. What is the harm in that?\nThere still is no violation. This provision respects no *establishment* of religion.\n\nThose are just three provisions that I cared argue specifically about.

Secular speech is not a problem, because by definition it cannot favor an establishment of religion. Religious speech is a problem, however. It must be dealt with specially because of the First Amendment. The school officials are clearly not allowed to get involved in religious speech, as that would be a situation where it would be accused of favoring a particular religion. *But*, the school provides many places where students can express themselves - every piece of written work and every platform where a student can speak.
