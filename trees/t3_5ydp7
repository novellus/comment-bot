The rivers were a thick toxic liquid which froze in Nifelheim. From these frozen river a mist rose, that turned to a cold rain that turned into white frost. Over long time, Ginnungagap was filled with this white frost, which was solid ice near Nifelheim and molten slag near Muspelheim. The drops from molten frost gained life near Muspelheim and formed into the giant Ymer. He was a frost giant and from birth evil. From the sweat of his left armpit when he slept a man and a woman grew forth, and his legs copulated and had a son, the forefathers of the frost giants.\r\n\r\nWhen the thawing continued, a cow emerged from the frost, she was called Adumla and Ymer lived fo the four rivers of milk that flowed from her. Adumla nourished by licking the frost of salty stones. Out of the stone, she licked during three days forth the shape of a man, who came to life. His name was Bure. He married a daughter of one of the frost giants and had thre sons, Oden, Vile and Ve.\r\n\r\nOden, Vile and Ve hated the frost giants and their ever-increasing numbers and brutal and barbaric ways. Finally they atatcked Ymer and slayed him. The blood pouring from his body drowned all the frost giants except Ymer's wife and the people of her farmstead.\r\n\r\nOden, Vile and Ve carried the body of Ymer into the middle of Ginnungagap and created the world from his body. His flesh became earth and his bones became mountains. His blood became lakes and seas. They lifted his skull and made the heavenly half-sphere from it. They placed a dwarf at each corner to guard the heaven, the dwarves were named \u00d6stre, V\u00e4stre, Nordre and S\u00f6dre (roughtly Easty, Westy, Northy and Southy). From sparks from Muspelheim they created the starts.\r\n\r\nThe brothers gave the remaining giants an area by the sea to live and called it Jotunheim. Since the the giants were still hostile, they took Ymer's eyebrows and made them into the walls of a fort. The fort they called Midg\u00e5rd. They tossed Ymer's brain into the skies were it became clouds.\r\n\r\nOne day Oden, Vile and Ve was walking along the shore and found an ash and an almtree that had washed ashore. From them they crafted man and woman. Oden breathed life into them and Vile gave them an understanding mind and a good heart, while Ve gave them hearing and sight.
