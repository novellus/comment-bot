If on the other hand you are trying to sell at platinum levels on a regular basis certain consistants need to be there. For example One of the most simple is avoiding repetition while maintaining a \"sound\" for the band. Most band demos have 2 sometimes 4 songs that are almost identical either in instrumantion or chord structure. To the band they sound completely different. To the good producer he is going to pick the most marketable song and toss out the others. The band would make the record and put them all on there. That's one main difference. I heard it said back in the 70's that the Beatles had over 400 hours on unreleased recording's that \"didn't make the cut\". Although they went on to make the Anthology Set, McCartney later explained that although there were hours of songs recorded, they could not come up with either good instrumentation or background production capable of making them really move everyone so they were dropped.\r\n\r\nI am sure like most musicians you and I love to record and listen to our own music the way we like it but that is a far different thing than trying to take an unknown band with a very raw sound and turn them into a platinum selling group. This is where I think the record companies offer value. While I have no doubt that the internet will expose a couple of superstars over time I also think that there are a lot of raw people that without the help of a record company wiould not make it.\r\n\r\n", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "parent_id": "t1_c02cge2", "id": "c02cgqt", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c02cge2", "ups": 2, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5zj65", "retrieved_on": 1427424847, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02cge2", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "parent_id": "t1_c02cg6b", "body": "\n\nLots of band produce, mix and master their own records.

I can't tell you how many bands come into my studio every week with demos that they made and or produced that sound horrible because of a lack of good basic production work. They spent $$$$$ and got crap. Many times record companies just bag the band tapes and record from scratch altogether. \r\n\r\nIt is production that makes the hit not the mix and master.
