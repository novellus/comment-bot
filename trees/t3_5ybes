We want a world without an environment, and if we have to invade Iraq to find the environment and kill it, we will.  We will sacrifice as many US soliders as it takes, but we will hunt down and kill the environment because we hate the environment.\r\n\r\n&gt;So you have no problems at all that cheney uses as much if not more energy then gore, you just want to shit on gore because he asks people to use less energy.\r\n\r\nWhich part of the definition of hypocrisy don't you understand?

It infuriates Republicans that Gore receives so much recognition (culminating in his shared Nobel prize) for what they perceive to be, well, doing nothing. Gore is a talker, a champion of causes, but the fact that he gets so much recognition for this, instead of the \"doers\" (scientists, researchers), clashes with conservative values. This is why he got jumped all over for the (incorrect) quote about inventing the internet, because it proves their point that he's just out to puff up his chest and steal the limelight from the people that matter.\n\n \n2. Global Warming awareness seeks to limit your (and businesses) freedom to do whatever the hell you want...and Al Gore is the face of this cause. \"How dare Al Gore tell me I have to stop driving my Tahoe!\" Repubs think responsibility for climate change should be up to the individual, not government regulation.\n\n3.

They can do no good thing in Mr. Hannity's eyes.  \"Hannity's America\" indeed and every time I hear someone say \"YER A GRATE AMERICAN SHAWN\" I just want to scream.  Some people just buy what Fox News is selling outright without checking the facts. That started to really change for me when I saw how unfairly they were treating Bill Clinton who even if he was doing bad stuff once before, is now at least trying to redeem himself and I am not sure he ever was a bad person in the first place and not just framed and shot down by the corporate media.  This documentary is pretty enlightening.\n\nhttp://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=411888315354425208\n\n   Personally, I wish Bill Clinton was back in office right now and we had the sort of problems we had then.  He at least tried to get Osama Bin Laden. It is funny too because as far as I can see, Bill Clinton has started supporting some great humanitarian causes and is trying to do some good in the world and after what happened to that guy, it is a wonder that he doesn't hate everyone and just hide in the closet or something.  As far as it goes for me and what I believe about the environment, I believe what the Bible says and what it says in Genesis 8:21-22 and Genesis 9:9-9:16.
