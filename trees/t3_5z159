What do I have to do with it?\" Then you get back to blaming black people for their own problems.\n\n     There is a feeling that I have a \n     responsibility for their problem, that I\n     am the solution to it, that I have much \n     to do to ensure their inclusion into the\n     greater society.\n\nAs for the feeling you have that you, personally, have responsibility for their problem- get over it! I, personally, don't feel a shred of guilt for hundreds of years of black oppression. It wasn't ME that did it.\n\nBut that said- if you really want to see more  harmony in the world, maybe you should stop looking to blame other people, period, and leaving it at that. Look at the conditions that cause things. You dont have to dedicate your life to activism or any junk like that. You don't have to live your life in guilt for the actions of others. But open your eyes to whats happening in the world. Don't buy into the safe little knee-jerk reactions that make \n US feel better about OURselves, without doing a thing to reach out to anyone else or understand anyone else's point of view. This goes beyond black-white relations. It can be applied to a lot of situations.\n\n\n     I'm not focusing on losers like  \n     Farrakhan, but many in the black \n     community will give him and others like\n     him the power to influence.\n\nNo, the conditions give him power and influence. Without the conditions present in the US, (the Jena 6, Gnarlow Wilson in prison \n for accepting a blow job), he would have no influence because no-one would have any need to turn to him in the first place.\n\nImagine if Israel wasn't smacking down Palestinians unilaterally, and the USA hadn't invaded Iraq with a \"Shock and Awe\" policy. Do you think Al Qaeda would have anywhere near the recruiting pull that they do right now?\n\nOf course not. US actions are driving recruits into the terrorist's arms. Misery makes those people possible. That certainly doesn't excuse what they do, or make the terrorist acts committed in their name forgivable. But to ignore our own role  in their creation is to ensure that the cycle never breaks.\n\nAs soon as anyone starts talking about that though, someone shouts, \"Oh sure, blame AMERICA for what they do! Blame AMERICA for all the people they kill!\n\nThis might come as a surprise, but \"Blaming\" America has nothing to do with it! Blaming people never solves shit. The point is- \"What can WE do to solve this problem, from OUR end? I'm sure there are Arab leaders urging people to ignore Al Qaeda too. That's great and a big help. But in the meantime, does that mean its okay for blackwater and Aegis to keep on shooting people without provocation and/or for fun?\n\nI'm tired of this \"blaming\" shit. All people ever seem to care about is not feeling guilt, and finding someone else to blame for how things are.\n\nFuck guilt. Fuck blaming, be it towards black \n OR white. Just let it go, and see the world the way it is, even if it isn't pleasant.

I'm not focusing on losers like Farrakhan, but many in the black community will give him and others like him the power to influence.  It was the black community that started hyphenating their name as African-American. This is what, exactly, except a further way to ensure that your seen as separate from the rest?  \n\nThere is a feeling that I have a responsibility for their problem, that I am the solution to it, that I have much to do to  ensure their inclusion into the greater society. I'm quite sure everyone is capable, it's just a matter of being responsible for yourself, your family, neighborhood, city, etc, etc.  How far must I go, how much responsibility is everyone else accountable for, how much do these inner communities owe themselves, before we stop considering it an issue?

I think that's a stupid way to look at it. Who gives a shit what color whoever did it was? What are we, a bunch of gangs?\n\nI come from Canada, where as you said yourself people get judged on what they do, rather than what their skin or history is, remember? If my friend who happens to be Indian or black is having a hard time, I don't \"blame white people\", I blame the shitheads. I don't defend him because I feel sorry about something that went on with his ancestors. I don't care about what happened a hundred years ago. I care about what's right and what's fair, and I would do the same thing for you.\n\nAre black groups right in \"blaming white people\" for all their problems? I doubt it. I don't see what it will do constructively.\n\n But how are *you* any different? Instead of blaming white people, you're blaming THEM, the \"black people\". Its the same level of bullshit- You just happen to be on the other team!\n\n     In the US, much of what passes for \n     acceptable social behavior would be and \n     is considered quite rude by Canadian \n     standards. Race has nothing to do with   \n     it.\n\nWhy do you think that is? How do you think we enforce that effectively?\n\nDo we do it with the death penalty? By promising to be extra nasty to people that break rank?\n\nThe only reason we can hold each other to those standards of behavior is because we ALSO share the same community and opportunities, and give equal respect to one another. You can't have one without the other. You can't treat a group of people worse than your own, but then expect them to behave just as nicely to yours for nothing in return. \n\nThink about how much more influence you have over the behavior of your friends and people in your workplace than you do over strangers.  In the USA, strangers could give a fuck about you. If you don't like him, scapegoat him, exclude him and have nothing to do with his life and block him out of your own, of course his attitude is going to be \"you don't give a shit about me, so why should I give a shit about you?\" And so that gives him the right to behave any way he pleases to you. He has no stake or interest in whether or not you like him or get along with him.\n\nBut if you want him to act different, you can't just rag on him to change HIS behavior, while doing nothing yourself. If you want to get along with him better, the initiative has to come from the larger group he feels cut off from. If you let him in, and offer him the same treatment and the same respect as everyone else, he'll respond.\n\n\nYou seem to think blacks are less of a \"problem\" in Canada because we're harder on them, yet despite the absence of these strict penalties, everything seems to work better. Why is that? \n\nIs it because we're meaner to \"black people\" that break the rules? Well apparently not. \"We're the 'nice guys'. Criminals get off with wrist-slaps compared to the US. SO a harsher outlook on people that do bad can't be it. So what is it?\n\nThe reason is because we don't see \"our blacks\" as a \"problem\". And that's because there ARE no \"our blacks\". We're all Canadians, period. We respect one another, and we hold ourselves to the same rules and standards. And the reason we can do that is because we share the same community and opportunities.\n\nJust imagine if Louis Farrakhan came to Canada and tried to get people there riled up about black power, special rights, etc. People would just think it was weird and no-one would take it seriously. That's because there's no \"white man\" to rebel against. There's no white and black...just US. And united we get along better.\n\nSo stop focusing on losers like Farrakhan...focus on the conditions that make \n people like him possible in the first place.

In the US, much of what passes for acceptable social behavior would be and is considered quite rude by Canadian standards.  Race has nothing to do with it.  \n\nPointing out the problems in the US system is not difficult.  The issue I have, and will continue to have, is the idea that minorities, blacks in particular, have the right to say and do as they please because of the minority status, and their long history as second class citizens and slaves.  They have been empowered politically, and they use their political power to ensure that they remain seen as a separate and distinct social class.  Thats right, groups like the NAACP help keep those within the black community thinking blacks are separate and inequal.  You have a belief system that is feeding on it self, parents teaching their children that their future is hopeless because of someone else.  I've seen and heard it out of the mouths of parents for years, yet you want to blame white people for what is essentially a failing of black leaders.   \n\n\nWhat Cosby is saying here, and what others have said before, is that there is a responsibility of blacks to raise their kids in a decent manner, to take advantage of other parts of the system beyond welfare, and to take care of themselves.  I view Cosby's comments as a part of the internal dialog within the black community that should take place if whats been happening is ever change.   At some point, you can't keep blaming others for everything, and you have to take responsibility for your own actions. But it's painted as a cause and effect of rich white America, oppression, and cultural bias.  \n\nI don't believe in the term reverse-racism.

Some people have been marginalized for so long they've created their own subculture.

Mr. cosby has the financial resources to make all the things that need to be started a reality, that was my point.\r\n\r\n&gt;unlike the other millionaires he talks about who played a little basketball, or football or whatever\r\n\r\nIs there something wrong with them obtaining their wealth in this manner, if they have the talent and drive to do so.  My thing is that I don't want all black kids thinking they can be the next Kobe or Jordon, they simply can not, and there are so many other things thay could strive to be.  Cosby is an example, and help could help them achieve this instead of berating, but I really know his heart is in the right place. Although he did get into an altercation with one of the Smothers brothers in the late 70s early 80s cause the guy was always hounding Cosby about how he wasn't doing enough for civil rights, I just thought that was funny.", "author": "ElectricSol", "created_utc": "1193333136", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c02bahi", "parent_id": "t1_c02b7l7", "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02bahi"}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "name": "t1_c02b7l7", "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5z159", "retrieved_on": 1427425427, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02b7l7", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02b5es", "body": "I think you'll find the people he's talking about are a generation or two further along than his own kids' generation.\n\nAlso he seems to be trying to raise interest in doing exactly what you're talking about - \"We have to begin to build in the neighborhood, have restaurants, have cleaners, have pharmacies, have real estate, have medical buildings...\" and while you might be a little peeved he's a millionaire, as you point out he got that way by making EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS like Fat Albert - unlike the other millionaires he talks about who played a little basketball, or football or whatever...", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "ups": -1, "name": "t1_c02b5es", "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5z159", "retrieved_on": 1427425527, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02b5es", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "parent_id": "t1_c02b57o", "body": "  I agree quit attacking people and offer SOLUTIONS we all know about the problems.

I'm glad that his full address was posted as its own post, so we can read it in full context.\n\nIt's clear that personal responsibility is part of the reason for the 12% dropout statistics (which he erroneously inflates to 50%) among the black community. But even Cosby isn't dumb enough to think that the fact that we have equal opportunity under the law means that things should have magically gotten better. He is still aware that there is a need to improve our mostly African-American neighborhoods, not just move into more affluent, mostly white ones as soon as we move up in the world.\n&gt;We have to begin to build in the neighborhood, have restaurants, have cleaners, have pharmacies, have real estate, have medical buildings instead of trying to rob them all.\n\nThere's still a place for \"black neighborhoods\" in this country (which isn't reverse racism, just an effort to reverse the effects of racism) because there are still plenty of places where blacks aren't welcome: equal opportunity doesn't guarantee equal success, and there are still plenty of instances of perfectly qualified blacks getting passed over for jobs in favor of whites, despite affirmative action.\n\nYes, we have equal opportunity. In fact, I can go interview for a job and I'm more likely to get it than I would be if I were white thanks to affirmative action, but statistics have shown that affirmative action has helped more white women than it has any other previously injured group. If I don't get the job I want, I know I can't blame it 100% on race, but I'd just be flat out naive if I just ruled it out.\n\nAlso, I don't usually like to lump every Redditor in by addressing the Reddit community as \"Reddit\" collectively, but I find it strange that Reddit upvotes posts like this as well as posts about abolishing mandatory-minimum sentences, which, in practice, are just glaringly racist.\n\nI mean come on, if you white boys can't find \"Tayshawn\" with the pants hanging off his ass, then where the hell are you gonna find a weed dealer?", "author_flair_css_class": null}
