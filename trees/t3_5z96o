Use the Buffalo HP routers, best bang for buck, great amp/radios. Flash with DD-WRT so you can boost the power and setup 2 in bridge mode. Use a great big 24d dbi parabolic/dish antenna ($60) on the ground, I've had amazing results from the top of big buildings with line of sight, you'll need an adapter to connect a big antenna.\n\nI imagine you could dangle a lower dbi parabolic (it'll be moving around up there) from the bottom and keep a pretty decent link established. Using the above stuff I managed a solid 20Mbit (good enough for Hi-Def!) link over a couple of miles.
