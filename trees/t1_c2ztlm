I happen to do all the layout myself &amp; email it off to the printers, but probably only because I enjoy it and because I'm ok at it - I don't *need* a graphic designer. Anyway, I work for myself, and have no employees, so the \"profits\" of my \"company\" are what you would call your \"wages\". $4000 is quite a whack of cash for me - I'd love to buy a new MacPro this year, or a new (secondhand) car and a fine like this would prevent me from doing so. So IMO it's quite a sufficient amount to discourage smaller companies such as mine from making a similar mistake in future.\n\nI have a customer with an office and a number of employees. They undoubtedly have a much larger turn- over than me, but nevertheless the company is managed by the owner and any increase in expenses affects what he takes home at the end of the year. This particular guy does have a nicer house than me &amp; a nicer car, but there are probably computer programmers &amp; accountants who make more. So I'm inclined to perceive the electronics store which was fined in this way, and that the fine might well have come out of the proprietor's pocket. You might not consider it enough, based on his estimated earnings, but it is his estimated earnings you should be basing your opinion on, not on whether or not he happens to be running a business. \n\nI know a number of owners of small businesses, all those I have in mind have employees, and none of those guys would consider $4000 to be a laughing matter. They would likely be sacking their graphic designer, or at the very least having stern words with him, and they would no way allow this sort of thing to happen again, were they slapped with such a fine.", "author": "strolls", "created_utc": "1192546495", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_c2ztlm", "id": "c029hc6", "author_flair_css_class": null}
