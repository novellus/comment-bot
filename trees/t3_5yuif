When the last of them withdrew (England and France, mostly) we pretty much drew lines across the map and said \"Right - you lot of warring tribes who hate each other are now 'Iraq'. You lot of warring tribes who hate each other are now 'Iran'\", you lot are 'Syria'\", etc, and got the fuck out without leaving much of a government structure behind.\n\n&gt; About the time the European powers withdrew (early 20th century) and the natives thought they'd get a decent shot at working things out for themselves, America came stomping onto the scene and started doing pretty much what the European powers had done for years - influencing, destabilising, deposing and generally pushing people about to get what they wanted.\n\n&gt; The only difference is that in the time the USA has been doing it the world has changed, and it's come to be accepted that it's not really acceptable to go stomping into countries waving your flag and demanding that everything belongs to you now, or deposing leaders simply because they don't agree with you, or because you'd really like a ready supply of cheap oil.\n\n&gt; In short, America is only doing what Britain and France and the like did before them. The difference is that we were doing it a hundred years ago when everyone was doing it to everyone else, and America's doing it now, when people have realised how completely unacceptable it is, and the natives concerned can get hold of bombs, guns and infectious diseases to fight back with.\n\n&gt; Not that terrorism is ever morally acceptable, ever, but there's this wonderful idea thriving in the USA that people in the Middle East hate you because you're \"free\", or because they've fucked their country up.\n\n&gt; Actually, they hate you because for the intervening century you've been fucking their country up as well, and making it harder for them to sort their differences out.\n\n&gt; That interpretation, however, requires America to self-examine, apologise for previous excesses and stop interfering further.
