But no one could explain why they chose this particular tree, or why the nooses appeared the day after Kenneth\u2019s question and the Principal\u2019s answer. \"\n\nHow about shitty coincidence?  Someone needs to point the author to the direction of the article how the mind likes to fill in blanks and make patterns out of randomization when no such meaning is in the data.  \n\n&gt; Finally, Franklin\u2019s theory can\u2019t explain why then-principal Scott Windham was so horrified by the noose incident that he recommended expulsion for the school year.  If this was simply a white-on-white practical joke, Windham\u2019s response can only be seen as a bizarre over-reaction. \n\nHow about because the principal realized the cultural meaning of it, and the potential timebomb it represented to race relations.  \n\n&gt; The logical conclusion is that Windham was never exposed to the theory Mr. Franklin is selling. \n\nThis is not logical at all.  To make it logical, you need to base it on an assumption about his underling mental reasoning, which you cannot do.  \n\n&gt; Last week, US Attorney Don Washington, finally admitted that the noose hanging in Jena constituted a hate crime under federal law.  Richard Cohen of the Southern Poverty Law Center has argued persuasively that the act also satisfies the Louisiana definition of a hate crime.\n\nOh sure, after you twist things around and make arguments, as to why it would be a hate crime.  However under the interpretation almost everyone had on the initial reading it  didn't satisfy those requirements and probably still doesn't.  This is probably a case of solid legal reasoning as allowing abortion to be legal under the disguise of the right to privacy.  Without getting into an argument about whether abortion is moral or not, lets face it that the use of the right  to privacy as legal justification is pretty poor, since it doesn't also apply to the ability to use drugs or commit euthanasia.\n\n&gt; But, like Mr. Cohen, I agree with the basic thrust of Franklin\u2019s argument here\u2013the noose hangers should not have been charged with committing a hate crime because they are juveniles who didn\u2019t understand the full import of their actions. \n\nSo if they didn't understand what they were doing? How can you classify it as a hate crime? This is a bit contradictory to me.\n\nThis is much too painful to watch logic and reasoning so carelessly disregarded... i can't read any more.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
