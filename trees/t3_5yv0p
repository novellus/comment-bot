E Meters rule!\r\n\r\n&gt;Although Hubbard's name is on the patent application, the E-meter was actually invented by a chiropractor named Volney Mathison, and was originally called the Mathison Model B Electropsychometer.\r\n \r\n&gt;Mathison also marketed a cheaper Mathison Quiz Meter and a manuscript on \"Electropsychometry\" by L. Ron Hubbard and himself. \r\n\r\n&gt;Mathison's Electropsychometer was promoted as an aid to psychotherapy and psychoanalysis, which is anathema to Scientologists!\r\n\r\n&gt;The more modern \"bathroom scale\" E-Meter design was registered with the US Patent and Trademark Office in 1997 under registration number 2056778. (Thanks to Scientology attorney Samuel D. Rosen, of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &amp; Walker, for pointing this out.) Here is the trademark registration. In August 2001, Scientology also registered \"E-Meter\" as a word mark; the registration is here. But there are many other commercial uses of the term \"E-Meter\"! It appears the main point of the trademark registration would be to prevent FreeZone groups from marketing their own electropsychometers under this name.\r\n\r\n&gt;Needle actions can be faked. Martin Hunt confessed to faking an F/N (floating needle, a movement that signals the end of an auditing process) by gently squeezing the cans. E-meter drill 9 and drill 13 are supposed to teach auditors to recognize such actions, but they don't always catch them. Patrick Jost and Arnie Lerma have found that a violent needle movement called a rockslam can be produced simply by checking the electrode leads, or by corrosion in the plug contacts.\r\n\r\n&gt;The ``metabolism test'' done at the start of each session has nothing to do with metabolism.\r\n\r\n&gt;The mechanical meter movement is specially designed to bounce around a lot, producing extra ``phenomena'' for the auditor to interpret.\r\n\r\n&gt;The US Food &amp; Drug Administration raided Scientology on January 4, 1963 and seized hundreds of E-meters as illegal medical devices. The incident is described in Jon Atack's book, A Piece of Blue Sky, and in this essay by Stephen Barrett, M.D. Since that time, meters have been required to carry a disclaimer stating that they are purely a religious artifact. This appellate court decision describes the trial and the various witnesses who appeared.\r\n\r\n&gt;This subsequent court decision says in part: \"As a matter of formal doctrine, the Church professes to have abandoned any contention that there is a scientific basis for claiming cures resulting from E-meter use. The Church, however, continued widely to circulate Scientology literature such as Government's exhibits 16 and 31, which hold out false scientific and medical promises of certain cure for many types of illnesses.\" Also see this decision by the US District Court in Minnesota concerning the E-meter and unlawful medical claims.\r\n\r\n&gt;The 9th Circuit reached a similar conclusion, noting that \"Labels of disclaimer, to-wit: 'Not intended or effective for the diagnosis, treatment or prevention of any disease,' found on about half of devices, were not controlling in determining whether devices were mislabeled within Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and thus subject to prohibition of importation, but were to be considered together with any extrinsic evidence of intended use of device.\"", "author": "[deleted]", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c02amed", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "name": "t1_c02amed", "parent_id": "t3_5yv0p", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}
