EDIT: That may not be entirely accurate. But I certainly wasn't buying into the view you're rebutting, which is that \"all Christians are alike\".\n\nPlease note that in my response, I'm pointing out the two (opposing) jabs I've seen on the issue coming from self-avowed Christians.\n\nThis has absolutely no bearing on the percentage of Christians in America who are secular, etc. If you think I didn't already know this, or am arguing against it, or am even slightly inclined to argue against it, then obviously you misconstrue the point.\n\nI bristle at saying \"we are a Christian nation\" for several reasons. As I said above, Christianity was a belief that only some of our founding fathers held (and many of them opposed it vehemently). There's also the damage that is done in our own perception (and around the world!) when we use the phrase \"America is a Christian nation,\" because it implies a de facto state religion--something that the founding fathers obviously opposed, and which encourages the worst of our enemies to take their own religious fundamentalism as an oppositional stance to ours.\n\nHere's a new reason: we're *not* a Christian nation. Reading the New Testament--especially the Sermon on the Mount--can you honestly say that America is a nation based on these teachings? With almost the highest infant mortality rate in the industrialized world? The worst unemployment benefits? The worst health care for its un-rich citizens? The highest degree of stratification between ultra-rich and the rest of its citizens?\n\nIf someone were to say to you, \"Imagine a nation based on Christianity,\" isn't that just about the opposite of what you would expect?

Read *my* response closer. What I in fact said (attributing the remark to the general body of Redditors who have used it against me) was more subtle, and involves creating a more or less unanimous body of \"Christians\" who are more or less homogenous in not thinking that America is a Christian nation. This view is largely trotted out to rebut any non-Christian who says that it's unpleasant to walk into the wind of \"America is a Christian nation.\" The response basically amounts to, \"Huh? What? You're imagining it. I'm a Christian, and I don't consider America a Christian nation; my friends don't say things like that; you must be making this whole thing up out of a persecution complex.\"\n\nYou didn't say any of those things, but what you *did* say becomes increasingly senseless if we try to find any other *inference* in it. You point out the vast number of Christians in America (inarguably true) and then leap to the notion that since they're not 100% unanimous in the view that America is a Christian nation, it is therefore silly or dismissible to complain that that view is widely held by Christians. It's basically the \"I saw a lion eating grass, so you're a liar if you say that lions are carnivores\" argument.\n\nIf that isn't what you were implying, then what *were* you implying when you referred to hundreds of millions of Christians in America, not all of whom feel that way? And do you not notice that your latest reply demonstrates precisely the view that you claim not to have made--that America is a Christian nation? \n\nIt's a dangerous game to claim that any belief held by the founders must therefore be an innate characteristic of America forever. English common law, first of all, wasn't Christian, and many of the founders rejected Christianity; second of all, many of the founders (including some of those who rejected Christianity!) were afflicted with prejudices and views of their age that we are very glad to move away from. If the intellectual heritage of America is its destiny, then let's first acknowledge that it's a more diverse heritage than you let on, and then let's all join together and despair of ever being secular, humanist, or scientific -- as we, what?
