To rephrase it a bit, the critical point is how do you maximize the number of people making a  *living wage*.\n\nIt's true - with a minimum wage you're more likely to wind up with one guy working and another not, as opposed to both working at sub-minimum wage.\n\nBut assuming that minimum wage is calibrated to be the minimum *living* wage (big assumption, I know), then it becomes a question of having one guy making a living wage or neither.\n\nOr, if you scale it up - let's say there's 100,000 laborers, and 90,000 are getting minimum wage. We could lower the wage until all 100,000 are employed... but in that case, you'd have 100,000 who can't afford to eat rather than 10,000.", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "name": "t1_c029aza", "parent_id": "t1_c2zwsd", "ups": 1, "author_flair_css_class": null}
