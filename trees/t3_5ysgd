He says: \"_Philosophers and theologians over the centuries, grappling with what is meant by \u2018God\u2019, have resorted to a different type of language, making statements such as \u201cGod is ultimate reality\u201d; or \u201cGod is the ground of our being\u201d, or \u201cGod is the precondition that anything at all could exist\u201d, and so forth_.\"\n\nBut these statements about God are not abstract philosophical concepts; they are downright meaningless. \"Ultimate reality\"? What does that mean?\n\nI don't think the author knows what they mean. He's simply trying to retreat unscathed in the face of Dawkins' attack on the meaninglessness of the idea of God.", "author": "ferdinand", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c02aews", "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "name": "t1_c02aews", "parent_id": "t3_5ysgd", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}
