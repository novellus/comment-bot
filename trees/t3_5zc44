I had a Power Glove that I took apart and glued a broken Genesis controller onto.  It looked really crappy but I was extremely proud of it.  My parents still have pictures of me grinning in front of my master creation.\n\nI mailed off the letter and got a response from their legal dept a few weeks later asking me to get my parents to sign off on any rights to it.  I got my mom to and a few weeks later I got a really official letter from Sega telling me they couldn't use my idea because it used Nintendo's technology and because they didn't feel there was a big enough market for a product like that.  They were really nice to explain how much R&amp;D would have cost to develop such a product from scratch, and it was my first real introduction to economics.  They sent me few posters, including a really sweet Sonic &amp; Knuckles one and a coupon to get $10 off a Sega game.\n\nI was ecstatic about it.  I still have the poster somewhere in our attic and I was an avid supporter of Sega after that.  I saved up and bought a Sega CD, got a 32X for my birthday, begged my way into a Saturn, and spent all the money I made in summer working for a Dreamcast.  Practically all of those systems failed miserably (other than, arguably, the DC), but I didn't really care - taking a few minutes to write me a letter made me a supporter for life.\n\nYou don't see things like this today.  I sent a letter to Sony after my PS2 scratched up a bunch of games asking them why it was doing it.  I got a really snarky letter from them asking me if I was using pirated games.  It turned out that there was a small imperfection in the loader and I fixed it on my own with some sandpaper but it really put me off on Sony.

I built some mockups and photographed them and my dad helped me write up a letter which I sent to Hewlett-Packard. A week or so later, I got back a nice letter from their legal department with a release form that they asked me to sign so that an engineer could evaluate my idea. As I recall, it was very much \"we'll take a look, and you promise not to sue us and we promise not to use anything unless we pay you.\" I signed it and sent it off. \n\nThe week after that, I got a *very* nice letter from one of their engineers. He told me (as you might expect) that my idea was not really in their current line of work. However, he provided a capsule history of how HP was persuaded to get into calculators by the technical innovations of outside contributors. He encouraged me to keep developing to the point of a working model and, of course, thanked me for considering HP.\n\nI was absolutely thrilled. For years I was HP's biggest fan. They (pre-Florina HP) probably got at least $20K-30K worth of business from me (printers, plotters and calculators) over the years thanks to that one nice letter. \n\nAnd you know what?
