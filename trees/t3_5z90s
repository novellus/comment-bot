Cars that old have already passed their massive depreciation point, but are still very unlikely to have major problems.\n\nObviously, do your research (which is also easier to do on a 3+ year old car).  Go to forums, look at recalls, and ask the seller lots of questions.  I don't buy cars from kids, I generally buy cars from rich people who are upgrading (nice toyota -&gt; audi).  They're less concerned about haggling, and they have the resources to have taken better care of their car.  I never ever buy a used car from a dealer, that's the worst of both worlds, since he's trying to turn a profit AND you don't know anything about the car.\n\nIn most cases I've been able to sell the car (4 years later) for very close to what I've paid for it.  There's no way that's possible with a new car.", "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_5z90s", "name": "t1_c02bohb", "author_flair_css_class": null}
