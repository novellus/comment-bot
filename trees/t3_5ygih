I used to drive through that intersection daily, people haul ass all the along that stretch. I'd be shocked if the tropper was traveling within 20% of the posted limit.\n\n2.) Had a trooper not been involved the news report wouldn't have assumed a fraction as much. Also, it's just my observation from years of watching the news while getting ready for work, but any assumption certainly wouldn't have been in favor of the driver. \n\n3.) Even if every last thing suggested about Ferrel was true, you still have a responsibility when operating a vehicle to be aware and in control. If I wasn't on the lookout for drunks wandering into the street I'd smash 5 UMD kids every weekend in College Park. \n\nIt seems like the fact that someone died here is being downplayed just because an LEO was behind the wheel.", "author": "02J", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c029l5a", "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": "t3_5ygih", "name": "t1_c029l5a", "author_flair_css_class": null}
