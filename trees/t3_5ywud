I didn't come across it until the mid 1990s so I suppose I was a bit late to the party on that one, but it's really a great book that even a kid can understand.  What made it so accessible was that it explained each new language feature with a story of a problem that a computer could solve, then showed how to write the program.  The stories were illustrated and interesting enough that I read the whole book without even bothering to turn on the crufty old hardware.\n\nSadly, programming isn't nearly as accessible nowadays as it was back then.  Windows doesn't even come with anything more robust than .BAT scripting... surprising, considering that Microsoft's first product was a BASIC interpreter for a hobbyist computer.  It's nice that you can get a free version of Visual Studio now, but just think of how great it would be if it was bundled with Vista and came with a fun set of programming tutorials.", "subreddit": "programming", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_c02aumx", "name": "t1_c02bcte", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2fwo", "name": "t1_c02aumx", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 5, "link_id": "t3_5ywud", "retrieved_on": 1427425666, "id": "c02aumx", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02arbf", "body": "+1; it's a classic.\n\nLots of programming books back in those days were far more entertaining than today's dry tomes :/", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2fwo", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 8, "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": "1193166292", "children": [{"controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "programming", "author_flair_text": null, "name": "t1_c02aw3e", "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5ywud", "retrieved_on": 1427425647, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02aw3e", "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": "1193175619", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2fwo", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_c02auxk", "body": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "programming", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 8, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5ywud", "retrieved_on": 1427425663, "id": "c02auxk", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02auxk", "parent_id": "t1_c02arbf", "body": "&gt; It's also now available for free.\n\nInteresting web site, that one.
