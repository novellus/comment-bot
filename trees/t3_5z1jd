They look like and are considered total fools on the hill. They are causing not only the public but congressional perceptions of anti-war activities as being small and limited to a group of wacky individuals and now have succeeded in causing DEMs to largely back off from war issues in order not to be associated with them.\r\n\r\nI wish I could tell you how rediculous they look. I was in the halls when they brought them out. They were happy! The whole stupid thing was a show. They get into these things by standing or paying people to stand in line all night, then 6-8 of them get in with the intention of preventing testimony. The intention is that every ten minutes or so one of them will start shouting for the cameras. When one gets thrown out the next one waits and then starts in 10 minutes later. God they come off stupid. I've even seen some guy who is dressed up as a woman in order to be part of it. Oh man oh man does that come off stupid. It's even beyond laghter now. \r\n\r\nCongress people are really fed up with them. Did you notice that they are now clearing them ALL out when one of them starts in. I'm amazed that one of them could get so close to the Secretary Rice. That protestor was lucky she was not punched and tackled by security in a much stronger way but I'm guessing they are used to it now. The other thing is that when they are taken out it looks like they are taught to make as much noise as possible because the minute the guards start forward to take them out they start screaming \"your hurting me\" and making as much noise as possible. It's so incredibly obvious its phoney. They also resist and sit down so the guards have to pick them up. That's when they roll and fall into other people and objects and can really get hurt not to mention hurting other people sitting in the seats near them.\r\n\r\nThen they come out jumping up and down as if they can't wait for this to hit the news cycle. I'm telling you that they are singlehandedly destroying all, and I mean ALL credibility for people people who do not support the war.\r\n ", "author_flair_css_class": null}
