The state got involved for racially motivated reasons.  Originally, marriage licenses were only needed for interracial couples.  It wasn't until years later that it was passed across the entire board.\n\nAs a doctor and a libertarian, I'm sure Ron Paul knows the real reasons.  He just doesn't want to sound any more radical than he already does, especially with half the crowd booing him, as is.\n\nI am not a Ron Paul supporter, but I love the guy.  I simply relate to Dennis Kucinich's economic philosophies. \n\nHowever, other than Kucinich or Gravel (lol, like crazy old Gravel has a chance) I would vote Paul over any of the democratic contestants (I use that word, rather than candidate, intentionally).  This is coming from a card carrying member of the **socialist party**.  As much as I disagree with him on some economic issues, the #1 economic issue (and, simultaneously, foreign policy issue) that should be on **all party's** to do list is getting out of this war.  \n\nOnce that happens, let the libertarians and socialists decide, in the republican (with a small \"r\") manner, in which we are supposed to decide things in this country, what to do with the extra billions of dollars.  No matter which side wins that debate, things will be better than they are now.\n\nAs diverse as they are, I think guys like Paul and Kucinich should be uniting, rather than working against each other, right now.  We need to all get on the same page.\n\nI think it would be a good idea for all of us Kucinich supporters to agree to vote Ron Paul, but only **if** Paul promises to run Kucinich as his VP.  If you add their percentages together, you have a candidate with nearly as much support as the front-runners.  On their own, it is unlikely either will ever be anything more than a \"fringe\" candidate. \n\nI have a lot more thoughts on this and ideas how to make it work.  If this comment gets upmodded enough, I will write a blog about it.
