This is such a blanket statement, ignorant and THAT is obscene.  \r\n\r\nConcerning Roe v. Wade, I think that every personw will agree the method by which we do abortions are horrific. most basically Scisscors to the fetus brain- This is terrible for the organism, and terrible for the mother carrying it.  In a world where you didn't have to worry about shrinking jobs, corporate squeezing of the middle class, etc. You would be much more able to raise a child properly instead of getting an abortion.\r\n\r\nRemember retard, Roe v. Wade only mandates federally that abortion is a viable choice.  Repealing Roe v. Wade would only serve to allow States their own choices on what to do about it.  Surely some would outlaw it, some would allow it- who cares.\r\n\r\nI do not know Ron Paul's position on the UN, but perhaps he does indeed want to withdraw from it.  As a political science major I can tell you that the UN is mostly useless anyhow with the USA being one of the sole architects of the system which pretends to vote on issues, but in truth is really just a way for the US to assert its hegemony in the rest of the world, not to mention this organization entirely toothless- unable to do anything except sanction countries.  The world would see us as concentrating on our own massive domestic issues, and I don't think anyone else's percetion of the US could get any worse than it is now (except for perhaps a european reading some of your responses)\r\n\r\nAccusing you of working for republicans is logical considering you simply badmouth everybody with ill-conceived ideas and rhetorical implementation of those ideas.  \r\n\r\nI have issue by issue responded to your blog-troll-flaming and havent avoided anything.

I'm not trying to be holier than thou by saying that- I'm just making the point that it is misguided to [boast](http://images.somethingawful.com/inserts/articlepics/photoshop/05-21-04-magazines/dorquemada.jpg). \n\nThis is the same tone that I see repeatedly with political zombies (most especially ron paul fans) here on reddit.\n\nAll you do is give your mental energy to some rich white guy and pretend that that really means something to the greater good.  I've go t news for you: your vote doesn't count.  The lunatic who you advocate will not even be on the ballot!\n\nBy the way, being from such a progressive institution as UCLA I find it obscene that you support Ron Paul.  Try bringing up the fact that Dr. Paul would in effect end Roe v. Wade in certain areas of the country next time your chatting with one of the lovely ladies on campus.  See how far that gets you.\n\nWhats even more shocking is that you claim to be a poli sci grad.  This to me, demonstrates the worthlessness of your degree for the sole reason that you actually support a man who would have the US WITHDRAW FROM THE UNITED NATIONS.  The United Nations is the only international peacekeeping organization that the world has, by the way.  What kind of effect do you think that this would have on our already sullied, shit covered reputation on the world stage? \n\nAccusing me of working for republitards is the equivalent of calling me a poopy head on the playground.
