Do you honestly think that if instead of a random 81 year old guy (who probably couldn't do shit with those knuckles anyway) it was the TSA workers own 81 year old father, that they would have reported him to anyone? I seriously doubt it. That worker could have used some discretion and just let him go. The mere fact that the guy was telling everyone to \"just take it\" shows that he was no threat.
