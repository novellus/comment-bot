I've been a console gamer since the Atari 2600. but I've also been a PC gamer since the Commodore 64.

It's not that I'm one or the other, I follow the quality; I'm a connoisseur, if you will. I consider myself well versed enough to make an unbiased distinction.\n\nIt's certainly no puzzle why Halo is so popular in comparison. PC gaming is an *expensive* hobby if you want to keep up with the tech. So consoles, often costing about as much as a good video card alone, tend to be a much more accessible option to the mainstream, especially since you only have to swap them out once every 5 years or so.\n\nI'd hesitate to use the term *jealous*, though. (old-school) Gamers in general always been kind of an elitist group, and the majority of PC gamers would probably *hate* it if everyone from xbox live started playing with them (This is one reason I don't think multi-platform multiplay will ever really hit it off).   \nIt's just that when a game like Halo 2 gets a higher rating than a game like Half-Life 2 from the same publication, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. Regardless of the console sensation that Halo might be, HL2 was an unequivocally superior experience for those to whom it was available.\n\n*My* problem, from a state-of-the-industry standpoint, is now every game developer is trying to ride the Halo 2 success train and putting out all these crap FPS titles for consoles.
