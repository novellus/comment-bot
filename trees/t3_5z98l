Accordingly, it is not possible that some edge case lays outside of our field of observation. Good to know.\n\n\u2026\n\nOf course, as it turns out, it's computationally infeasible to do Maxwell's equations for all but the most simplified of systems. That is to say, it is not possible to work out whether a structure as large as a cell is following Maxwell's laws in all its atomic components or not, due to the incredible amount of computation it would take in order to work them out. Further, there is the observational impossibility of recording the positions of all the particles in a cell without disturbing them in our measuring. So, really the whole thing really just rests on a thought experiment, not actual, possible experiments at all.\n\nNevertheless, let's bracket all that and pretend that we do in fact have observational evidence that Maxwell's equations have described the motion of all matter up until the present day. Even in that case, we would still be stuck with the problem of induction. \n\nTo illustrate the problem, say for example, that you observe the following sequence in nature:\n\n1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13\u2026\n\nAs you are no doubt aware, this is the Fibonacci sequence. Or is it? The Fibonacci sequence is defined as F(1) = 1, F(2) = 1, F(n) = F(n-2) + F(n -1). But, if we're allowed to define the Fibonacci sequence like that, why not define the tomashark sequence as F(1) = 1, F(2) = 1, F(3) = 2, F(4) = 3, F(5) = 5, F(6) = 8, F(7) = 13, F(n) = F(n-7) + F(n-1). For the Fibonacci sequence, we'll predict the next thing to be observed is 21. For the tomashark sequence, the next thing to be observed is 14.  How can we in principle know in advance whether this sequence is the Fibonacci sequence or the tomashark sequence? Certainly, the Fibonacci seems simpler, but how do we quantify simplicity in the general case? What if there's something simpler than Fibonacci sequence that gives the same results for the first seven items? And even once we do agree on simplicity (perhaps by using Algorithmic Information Theory), there's still the question, \"Who said Nature is simple?\"\n\nAll of these same objection apply to any scientific law as well. \n\n&gt;&gt; Nevertheless, an honest scientist will admit that this is just an assumption\n&gt;\n&gt;It is a _testable_ assumption\n\nAh, then propose a test: What sort of phenomena, if observed, would allow us to know that the world is not comprehensible? How do we tell inexplicable phenomena apart from things that are merely difficult to explain? If we see some hard to interpret phenomenon, how can we tell it apart from an arbitrarily complex formula and say that this sort of thing could only be the work of cosmic incomprehensiblity? \n\nIf you cannot propose such a test, then the hypothesis, \"The world is comprehensible\" is non-falsifiable, and thus, non-scientific.

Athenaeus has a huge chip on his shoulder about Plato, and slagged him whenever he could, but when other sources are taken into account it's clear that he was not especially reliable (though he is the only source for accounts of some figures, so he's still very significant).  He wrote many hundreds of years after the events he describes, and had an agenda which compromised his integrity.  Thus there are also some very misleading figures in the list:\n\nClearchus of Heracleia left Plato to become a student of Isocrates, the anti-Plato, and then went on to seize rule of Heracleia.  He was murderous and cruel, but his form of rule was certainly nothing like the metaphor in the Republic.  You can read up on him in Memnon to see this.\n\nThe story of Kallippos and the situation with Syracuse is much more complex than any brief account can suggest, but the short of it is that Plato was trying to prevent a tyranny there in Syracuse, not sponsor one.  \n\nFrom what we know through Diogenes Laertius (as opposed to Athenaeus), while Hermias of Atarneus was a basileus, he was certainly not a tyrant in the modern sense of the term.  He was actually well regarded as a leader.\n\nSo you should take that list with a grain of salt.  Plato did have some former pupils at the Academy who went on to become tyrants, but given that Plato was running the first institution of higher learning which drew many and various figures it's no surprise that they had many and various careers.  Plato did say that he had tried to make some kings more philosophical (as opposed to making philosopher-kings), but that meant trying to persuade them to cultivate moderation, honesty, sincerity, to be introspective, and to not look on a life of pleasure or a life seeking wealth as the fundamental good.  That agenda was obviously abandoned by those who went on to be tyrants.\n\n&gt;Let me say that I very much disagree with the above paragraph on the notion that those people \"did not impose anything like a philosopher-kingship\". To the contrary I'd bet they followed Plato's ideas to the letter.\n\nWhat historical sources do you derive those views from?  I think that if you took a more scientific approach to historiography you'd find that your hypothesis was very poorly supported, esp. with only the unreliable Athenaeus to back it up.\n\nI'd say one obvious counter-argument to the idea that there were tyrants who attempted to create states following a constitution modeled on taking Plato's Republic literally is that when Aristotle enumerated the various forms of constitutions of the Greek states that existed, he did not mention any state that followed an attempt at realizing Plato's metaphor.  And certainly Aristotle was always happy to slag Plato then given the opportunity.\n\n&gt;Would you want to live in a state portrayed in The Republic?\n\nNow that depends.  If you mean it as Plato intends it, then as a metaphor it doesn't really sound all that bad it essentially sounds like Advaita Vedanta or Buddhism.  The account of training the guardians is a metaphorical account of a kind of set of mental practices akin to a kind of Yoga.  It's not everyone's kind of thing but I can think of many much worse kinds of things to be into.\n\nOn the other hand if you mean to take it as a literal state, then of course nobody would want to live there, not even a person who was in a privileged position (since they gain nothing from rule other than responsibility) though Plato himself pointed out that the state was only a metaphor to understand justice in the individual to show that the individual should choose justice as a good in itself.  \n\nDo you think that Plato regarded all people as literally residing in a cave watching shadows cast before them on a wall, or that each person sailed along in a literal chariot with a light and dark horse where the light horse would eventually sprout wings?   Taking the Polis described literally is to completely miss the point of the book, and intentionally ignore both the stated purpose of the work, and the fact that Soc. says plainly that no philosopher would ever attempt to create such a state literally or participate in such a state if others tried to create one. \n\n&gt;If there is a guide to how not to create an equitable state then The Republic is it.\n\nYes, it's not a guide to creating an equitable state.  If read it carefully, it's clear that isn't intended as such.  Many scholars have followed poor commentaries that mistake it as a political work, which is very sad, but if you ignore the commentaries and actually read the book you can't justify the position that it's a political work - you need to selectively ignore passages (and overarching themes), and read a lot into the work as well.

However, it can be argued whether these men became \"tyrants\" through studying in the Academy.

But Popper engaged in the very thing he was so hostile to.  He ignored the evidence, didn't actually take a serious historical look at Plato's actual works or influence, but rather just kind of made up an account that fit his prejudices.\n\nAthens' democracy ended while Plato was living, but he himself was not any kind of influence on those who destroyed it.  Plato's student Aristotle was a teacher of Alexander the Great, but Aristotle was pro-Democracy, and it's clear that his influence on Alexander's political thought was not strong in that domain.  After this period, while various Romans did read Plato, they tended to follow Neoplatonism.  Under the Empire, the Romans really didn't spend any time worrying about Political philosophy, since they had no hope to effect anything, so they focused on a personal idealism that was centered in a rationalist mysticism and sought enlightenment through meditation and contemplation.  \n\nUp to the 17th C. Plato carried on being interpreted in the West and in Islamic societies Neoplatonically.  From the Medieval period, through the Renaissance, and up to the Enlightenment this was the standard reading.  So up to that point while Plato was cited at times in treatises on political thought, his influence was negligible since he was regarded as a sage who taught about the quest for personal enlightenment and spiritual development, more than a political thinker.  Plato's influence on Augustine did show, and the Augustinian position that one was foremost a member of the City of God, not the City of Man reflects Neoplatonism very well.  Augustine was not a frequently cited thinker by tyrants, and the organization of states under Christendom reflect a focus on Christian thought far more than anything from Plato.\n\nOf course, since in the Republic Plato says flat out that the work is a study to find why the individual should hold Justice as a good in itself, develops the Polis as an analogy, and says that no philosopher would every attempt to establish or participate in actually making such a state, the Neoplatonic approach seems more faithful than those later interpreters who chose to selectively ignore Plato's words and assume that implications were more important than explicit accounts.  The commentaries on Plato went through the work of explaining how each element in the dialog was metaphorical.\n\nDuring the Enlightenment and beyond, political philosophy did at times refer to Plato, but it's very hard to find any important political thinker who followed Plato in saying that the ideal leader should seek a mystical experience through deep contemplation and meditation, and the strict cultivation of moderation, courage, wisdom, and justice.  Besides perhaps the Dalai Lamas in Tibet, the Yellow Emperor of China, and and a few other eastern kings that all were clearly not influenced by Plato it's hard to find any state that ever tried approach this ideal of a king who was disinterested in personal gain from his role as a leader and was a mystic.  \n\nWhen we look at political thinkers who did inspire tyrannies, certainly Machiavelli never cited Plato.  Marx was consciously hostile to the whole of Platonic thought, for where Plato was an idealist, Marx was a materialist, where Plato was a mystic, Marx regarded mysticism as other-worldliness, Plato was a metaphysician, Marx was a critic mf metaphysical thought, etc.\n\nI know of a few historical conscious attempts to create a Platonopolis, all failed completely, but none degenerated into tyrannies.

To a person who is concerned with logic and believes that reality is fundamentally objective, faith is like blinding yourself by stabbing your eye with a fork.\n\nWhat value is there to just arbitrarily *deciding* to believe something, in advance, when you don't know it's true, and furthermore evidence might contradict it in the future?  There is no value to this activity.  Even consistency of position itself has no value -- as long as consistency of reason is respected.\n\nI myself *believe* things of a certain sort -- about mortality and what it means to be a good person -- but the things I believe could not, by their nature, by contradicted with any evidence (such as what it means to be a good person).  I see these as *opinions* about what is the best way to act -- knowing full well that such a concept as \"being good\", could it even be precisely defined, is arbitrary.\n\nI have no problem with fellow humans whose opinions of this sort differ from mine.  Because we all share a common basis of facts and logical reasoning, we can resolve our differences.  Objective fact is the basis of agreement between individuals.\n\nHowever, when someone starts to venture into the area of *facts*, it makes **NO SENSE** other than to hold a position that's a *hypothesis* and to recognize **you might be wrong**.  \"People of faith\" tend to hold positions where objective evidence doesn't matter to them, and that their *opinions* are divine in nature.  This is the basis with which they have forced their beliefs on others throughout history, or simply murdered heretics, and caused innumerable amounts of harm to the world.\n\nFrom a rational perspective, this kind of faith can only be harmful to our world.  This faith holds back the progression of society by repressing dissenting beliefs and developments, and furthermore it encourages its followers to fanaticism by suggesting they ignore the arguments of opponents.\n\nThe \"people of faith\" love to bash atheists and make them out as immoral people with no respect for others.  Atheists, however, just like everyone, have ideas about right and wrong.  The difference is that atheists recognize the *subjectivity* of their beliefs, recognize that others might feel differently, and most importantly **don't** believe their opinions are divine in nature or superior to others' for this kind of arbitrary reason.\n\nWhile personal opinions about morality and ethics are fine, having \"faith\" about things that are objective and empirical is just stupid and confers no advantage to anyone.    \n\nAs an intelligent, educated person, *not* to denounce this kind of faith is actually a terrible thing in my mind because it is effectively condoning the idea that it's okay to have arbitrary \"beliefs\" about what are true and to ignore evidence that contradicts your beliefs.  I don't think we should intellectually tolerate *any* belief of this kind because it *always* is taken to extremes by certain types of people.  Any moderate religion naturally tends to support extremism because it encourages belief that (1) God ordains it (2) people of faith are somehow superior to others because of their faith (3) ignoring facts is OK. \n\nAs a scholar, I cannot understand why we would intellectually respect any person who publicly denounces rational thinking based on facts.  I look forward to the day when denouncing religion that holds falsifiable beliefs about the physical world is politically correct and common.  I think it is a terrible state of affairs that it's \"wrong\" to argue someone's position is silly just because it's their \"belief\".  *All* positions of any sort should be subject to scrutiny.  This is how society progresses.\n\nWhile there might be plenty of wonderful \"people of faith\" in the world, whose personal opinions are consistent with an empirical, scientific, objective reality, they are promulgating a sub-culture that **in its nature** permits  deliberate ignorance of fact.\n\nAny sub-culture that encourages *not thinking* and *just accepting what you're told as fact* is tantamount to encouraging people to fly planes into buildings.  There is no **fundamental** difference in nature between  those kinds of beliefs.  \n\nThat is to say, ordinary \"people of faith\" and fundamentalists are not fundamentally different in nature; pardon the pun.\n\nIf you believe God wants you to do something, what's to stop you from doing it?  If you are generally religious, and believe God has told people to do things in the past (insert holy book here), what's to stop you from believing that God is telling you to kill people now?\n\nWhat would, in a modern religion, stop you from going on a killing spree if you actually believed that God told you to do it?  This is an extreme example but the principle is general: you might do things that make no rational sense, and in fact make rational *unsense* if you will, all because some religious leader told you what God wants and you believe him.\n\nWhy should you **ever** accept what anyone tells you about God?  How the fuck do they know what he wants?\n\nNo action should **ever** be justified purely on the basis of faith.  For any action to be worth doing, it should be defensible on the basis of empirical evidence that *all* observers can agree on.

The only people this concerned with the limitations of the best system for understanding reality are those who really want to believe in magic. The reply to the slashdot comment was much more intelligent:\n\n by lukesl (555535)  on Saturday October 27, @06:12PM (#21143289)\nI don't disagree with all of your points, but I disagree with the conclusion you seem to be drawing. You state all these things that you call limitations of science and the scientific method, but as a practicing scientist, I see them more as fundamental limitations of reality. In other words, I believe that science (in its ideal form) is not only the best method we've found so far, but the best method there could possibly be.\n\n1. It's true that experiments are bad at dealing with rare events (I'm generalizing your statement by substituting rare for singular). The challenge, as a scientist, is to come up with a situation where you can study the same underlying phenomena in a system or regime where those rare events become more common. It's true that there are situations where this can be difficult or impossible, but saying that's a limitation of the scientific method is somewhat trivial. Science is dependent on observation, and you're saying that it doesn't work when you can't observe something. More on that below...\n\n2. Trust is less of a problem in science than any other human activity because science builds cumulatively on science done before. Despite what you suggest, direct reproduction is actually not even close to being the primary mechanism for validating past results. The truth is that new experiments are based on models constrained by old experiments, even if the new experiment is not a direct duplication of the old experiment. For example, your computer wouldn't work if all those experiments on electrons and whatever done in the 1950s were wrong. So old results, at least the ones that matter, are tested and retested every day as the findings are incorporated into the models.\n\n3. You seem to imply that it's possible to \"prove\" things in the real world, but I would argue that it simply is not, through science or any other method. You can prove things in math because math is all made up. Sevens don't actually \"exist.\" Those of us who operate in reality don't have it quite so easy. The type of \"proof\" you're talking about is not only impossible, but more importantly, completely unnecessary. We risk our lives every day wearing shoes we can't prove won't explode, using keyboards we can't prove won't electrocute us, confident that gravity will not fail us and fling us off the face of the earth. The level of certainty science can provide is sufficient.\n\n4. It is simply untrue that \"heretics have always received rough treatment\" in science. Look at Einstein, the most famous scientist of the 20th Century. Your example of the discovery of the role of H. pylori is more an indictment of the medical establishment, which at the time was very dogma-driven and insufficiently scientific in its thought (and remains so today). Also, those guys eventually won the Nobel, if you forget--hardly the Galileo treatment.\n\nI think the biggest problem with your understanding of science is that you seem to think that the sole activity of science is in providing \"facts\" and studying \"events.\" I would argue that the main activity of science is in creating models based on observations, then refining those models. You make a lot of the idea that science rejects unique events, but I would argue that the very idea of truly unique events is fundamentally incompatible with the model of the universe that science has provided (i.e. we're all made out of the same atoms, those atoms all move around according to the same rules, etc.). Science seeks not to collect random facts, but to discover the general underlying principles of reality (which you refer to as \"the natural world,\" as if to imply there is another).\n", "author": "Naught", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "archived": true, "subreddit": "science", "name": "t1_c02bq7n", "parent_id": "t3_5z98l", "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02bq7n"}

I answer the post with this short hand comment:\nI don't understand why you bring Popper into the equation. Popper wrote about the impossibility of knowing with certainty and he rejected the idea of inference as knowledge. There are things you Know, and there are things you Infer, until you can falsify the proof or you prove the inference is false, you are better off accepting the results as \"Scientific truth\". Scientific truth, as opposite to \"revealed truth\", religious truth, or any other form of truth that does not accept falsification, is a relative form truth and it is open to be replaced by any other truth at any moment.\nI think your confusion arises from the journalistic use of the \"scientific truth\" concept, as well as the political use of this concept (think of the Global Warming debate). Scientific truth is flimsy and always open to falsification, however, until falsified you are better off accepting it as an axiom from which you can build new hypothesis.", "author": "glaster", "created_utc": "1193583482", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "name": "t1_c02bsoc", "parent_id": "t3_5z98l", "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02bsoc"}
