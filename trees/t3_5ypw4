Jim was tripped out when writing the song after yet another fight with Pamela, his long time girlfriend. She had left a box of Tide on the table and he actually contemplated snorting some of it to see what it would do, but didn't. He was also thinking about his mother doing the laundry when he was a kid (again early 50's) and she used Tide. I'm not gonna go into his psychology, cuz then I'd be trippin' too. It was just a story that was relayed prior to Pam's death in 1974, and Manzarek has confirmed it. Just some food for thought, which I'm sure is wayyy too much infomation.
