Have you ever stayed in a 200 year old house? Even one that was designed to last 200 years? PFFFT: what a thoroughly revolting place to live.\n\nSimilarly, houses built today will NOT serve the needs of people 200 years from now. (Unless it is the only place to hide from wild dogs after the apocalypse.)\n\nHouses with an expected life time of 50 years is all that's required in this day and age: to bother spending the extra money required to ensure a house will last 200 years (Fucking hard, and bloody expensive let me tell you!) means building probably less than 1/3rd of the houses you need, or tripling the price of housing.\n\nYeah - I can see John Q.
