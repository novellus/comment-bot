LOL.\n\nLook, the world is going to keep burning coal until something much better and a lot cheaper is available.\n\nCurrently the only option is Bussard's Polywell Fusion reactor. It does not create or emit radiation, can't melt down, can't explode, and uses Boron as fuel - which is dirt cheap.\n\nStop worrying about things you can't change (coal/oil) and start worrying about thgings you can change: like lobbying your congressman to ensure that Amerika is the country which owns the rights to make the reactors. It's a multi-trillion dollar industry - so it's worth investing in.\n\nAs of now, the EMC2 team is only partially funded by the Navy for 1 more year. They need 200 Million to develop their production prototype. By an easy calculation, it's obvious that this investment will have the highest rate of return of any investment ever, in the history of mankind.\n\nForget about coal. And forget about oil too.", "author": "M0b1u5", "created_utc": "1193629655", "downs": 0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": "t3_5zbem", "name": "t1_c02bw42", "author_flair_css_class": null}
