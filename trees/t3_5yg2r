I watched most of the episode they did at Eastern State Penitentiary, where I was an intern and did tons of research two summers ago, and most of the historical information they gave was false. I didn't even see them try to talk to experts about it. The amount of activity they \"captured\" also seemed very fake. The Show Ghost Hunters on SciFi did an episode at the Winchester Mystery House and found absoultely nothing. They didn't even feel like the place was haunted, just strange.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
