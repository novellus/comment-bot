An equivalent article could be written by a junkie whose \"interview\" consisted of getting stoned with the hiring manager -- \"it worked really well for me!\"\n\nThat's tautological; it doesn't demonstrate that such a process will actually succeed when it comes to \"hiring good programmers\".  Indeed, good programmers are often so heavily recruited that they never even GO through a normal hiring process.  They wouldn't even *bother* with stuff like phoned-in brain teasers, considering them a good indication that the company is probably clueless, because that's not a very good way to find people.\n\n\n&gt; Instead of focusing on the details of the one experience I presented, try to look at the broader concept\n\nThe point that you made, \"When hiring a programmer, you need to see how they program\" is spot-on and also completely obvious.  The best way to do this is to see stuff they've already done that actually *works*.  Not toy problems, not how they do in a completely different environment (whiteboard vs. computer, being put \"on the spot\" vs. enough time to get in \"the zone\"), not how well they can convince you they're right.  \n\nSome of the best programmers simply won't be drawn into an argument over whether something works or not with someone who clearly doesn't understand their solution -- to them, that's why to run something on a *computer*, no arguing or convincing needed. \n\nSolving a toy problem doesn't tell you that someone has the diligence to work on a problem day after day with multiple parts that require not just \"hacking\" ability but large-scale organizational ability (in a structural sense, not a personnel sense).\n\nAnd personally I've heard so many brain teasers that chances are good I already *know* the solution without having to figure anything out.  That's probably why companies have shifted to unconventional questions without \"right\" or \"wrong\" answers to see what someone's reasoning process is, although without *any* proof that their *critique* of someone's reasoning process is in any way correct!\n\nThe best way to find programmers?
