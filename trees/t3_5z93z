What if I bought cheap investment land out in the desert (but not too far out, I need access to the power grid) then gradually invest in solar and wind power, then sell the generated power back to the power company to offset my personal power usage? \r\n\r\nWould others be interested in joining me in a \"low cost\" project like this? Maybe there are others already doing something similar?\r\n\r\nIf I buy the land, others might be interested in leasing/renting parts (and power equipment) on a sq/ft or per-watt basis to offset their power usage as well?
