But, I seriously question whether the US is ready for another gov't sponsored work program, no matter how lofty the goals. The WPA found traction because the US was coming out of the Great Depression and unemployment was high. We're not *yet* in the throws of the next greater depression. We will be. But, we're not there yet, and won't be in time for it to matter for Kucinich. \r\n\r\nWhile I appreciate the idealism, Kucinich's energy package is not realistic on many counts. The current political climate is ripe for capitalist win-win solutions, not more gov't boondoggles, and like it or not, a WGA program would be perceived by the vast majority as yet another bloated and unwanted gov't program. Whether we agree with that or not, most folks would likely not support increased taxes to fund jobs for some environmentalist tech nerds. Unemployment is low and rightly or wrongly the popular mood is that taxes are simply extortion used wastefully. \r\n\r\nKucinich also misses the enormity of real world energy needs. There's simply no current way to even meet current needs, much less anticipated future needs, with wind and solar. Nor will there be as long as coal and other fossil fuels are cheap. Given the choice between cheap dirty energy and slightly more expensive clean energy, the overwhelming majority will, perhaps somewhat guiltily, choose the cheaper, dirtier option. This has been proven repeatedly since at least the 1970's. \r\n\r\nKucinich is also naive if he thinks energy needs/wants/desires can be met in time without increased nuclear power options. (Believe me, I hate even typing that, but the truth is that there's no current way to get around that since we've wasted the past 40 years not dealing with the looming future energy needs in any serious manner.)\r\n\r\nThe situation isn't hopeless, (yet). There are some [proposals to encourage capitalist solutions](http://www.thebreakthrough.org/)\r\nThose may not be as ideal, but are certainly more politically palatable. \r\n\r\nRegular people are going to have to get a whole lot more uncomfortable before Kucinich's ideas gain mainstream traction. He's ahead of the times in some ways, and hopelessly idealistic in other ways.
