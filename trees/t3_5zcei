Data indicate that crime started to decline in 1992. Donohue and Levitt suggest that the absence of unwanted aborted children, following legalization in 1973, led to a reduction in crime 18 years later, starting in 1992 and dropping sharply in 1995. These would have been the peak crime-committing years of the unborn children.\n\n&gt;The authors argue that states that had abortion legalized earlier and more widespread should have the largest reductions in crime. Donohue and Levitt's study indicates that this indeed has happened: Alaska, California, Hawaii, New York, and Washington experienced steeper drops in crime, and had legalized abortion before Roe v. Wade. Further, states with a high abortion rate have experienced a greater reduction in crime, when corrected for factors like average income.[1] Finally, studies in Canada and Australia have established a correlation between legalized abortion and crime reduction.[1] \n\n[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legalized_abortion_and_crime_effect) ", "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": "1193678510", "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "author_flair_css_class": null, "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "ups": 6, "parent_id": "t3_5zcei", "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02bzpd"}
