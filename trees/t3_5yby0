Many airlines sell food, and that's okay, but they **sell** *peanuts* and *trail mix*.  They do give free non-alcoholic drinks, but only in tiny quantities, and only have, as an example, instant coffee.  This would be fine if they didn't load up their 737's with what feels like a 10\" seat pitch.  Add in that the crews are not particularly friendly, nor is anything about the airline convenient, and damn, I have a hard time recommending them.  To say the least.\n\nAirTran, nothing special in my book, is much better.  JetBlue is in a different universe.    So I'm really not surprised to see them with this stupidity.\n\nBut all that aside, this either is or could be a major issue on all airlines.  Even though my (regular) phone has an aircraft mode, I'm afraid to use it to play games because of things like this.", "author": "foxyvixen", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5yby0", "id": "c029am3", "author_flair_css_class": null}
