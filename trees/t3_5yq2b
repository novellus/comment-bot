All of the precedents for digital copyright are judicial findings or rulings that attempt to graft a solution in the absence of one provided by Congress.  However, this case is going to be tried in Gloucestershire County of the UK, so I don't imagine that they will be citing too many US judicial precedents, particularly since their whole system of is different than ours. Which is why I asked the question.\n\nSecond Issue: \n\n&gt;I am perfectly content to take the word of the professional lawyers\n\nSo essentially you would rather some one outside your industry create the rules for your industry? \n\nUnlike say murder and robbery, which are based on actual solidly codified law, with copyright issues almost all modern US results rest entirely on *judicial precedents*. The definitive laws on these matters in the digital world have yet to be written. Our current set of legal results therefore depend, in the US, entirely on the venue in which the cases are brought. Which is why you find many of the rulings against \"deep linking\" coming out of a specific court in Texas. Why are the cases shopped there? Because they know the judge will rule in their favor.\n\nThis isn't legal genius making these decisions, this is down and dirty lobbying and politics. Which is why every programmer should be actively reasoning for themselves about how the law should work, rather than listening to some corporate mafia tell them not to worry their pretty little heads. Do we just sit back and let Microsoft dictate how we should write code, based on how they have chosen to design their operating system? The people who write the software should very much want to have a direct say in all the laws regarding our work. I'm shocked that you would rant at me for my supposed lack of thinking and then conclude by proudly boasting of your willful abnegation to do so yourself.\n\n[So where do the standards of  Contributory infringement come from in the US?](http://www.eff.org/wp/iaal-what-peer-peer-developers-need-know-about-copyright-law)\n\n* Sony v. Universal City Studios, 464 U.S. 417 (1984)- Established the boundaries of Contributory infringement by finding that the values of non-infringing uses of technology could outweigh the damage done by potential infringing uses of that same technology.\n\nIn this decade we have had three cases that caused a revisiting of this judicial standard\n\n* A&amp;M Records v. Napster, 239 F.3d 1004 (9th Cir. 2001)\n\n* In re Aimster Copyright Litigation, 334 F.3d 643 (7th Cir. 2003)\n\n* MGM v. Grokster, 125 S.Ct. 2764 (2005)\n\nWhile the first two cases found some grounds to apply both Contributory and Vicarious liability, it wasn't until 2005 that the Supreme Court could return to the issue to potentially clarify it's \"beta max standard\". However instead of clarify exactly how the traditional secondary liability doctrines work they spontaneously created a new standard of \"Inducement\", to duck the issue. The idea being let's let Congress sort this out, while at the same time preventing the lower courts from participating in the design of imposed technical solutions upon the defendants (read technological disruptors) in order to placate the desires of the plaintives (read existing monopolies). The court wisely does not want to limit the marketplace.\n\nAs for deep linking; what's the real issue with TV-links? Did they create or distribute any software? No. Did they actively deny the ability to locate the source of infringing copyright? No. While the submitter of this article claims TV-links applied some type of url magic which denied copyright holders from identifying the sites hosting the infringing material, the reality is that the infringing files were flowing directly from the servers holding the content to the viewers, and therefore  ownership of those servers could be determined by analyzing that stream of data. Is there some type of inducement standard in the UK? I have no idea, but I'll be very surprised if the UK judiciary defers to the US supreme court on this. What's going on, more than likely is that the MPAA, RIAA crowd is acting through a proxy trade group in the UK to deny successful and logical innovations that identify key flaws in their current monopoly distribution practices.\n\nIs this what we really want? Established monopolists dictating the future of our industry to preserve out dated business models? Particularly given that our industry does a better job doing what their industry is supposed to be doing? What prevents copyright holders from putting their shows on demand on the Internet and inserting commercials into their content? Nothing at all. Comedy Central is already staggering toward doing this efficiently.\n\nShould the Buggy-Whip makers dictate how cars should be designed and built, merely so that those buggy-whip makers can stay in business? And more importantly should a group that provides facilities for doing straight forward link aggregation get punished for being in the crossfire? I would say absolutely no! Precisely because of the potential chilling effects that restrictions on both link aggregation and URL usage could impose on the many other extremely beneficial and publicly useful parts of the Internet.\n\nThat you would feel that other minds were better suited to resolve this issues than your own, and that you would implicitly advocate this abdication to the rest of the programming community is still the most stunning part of this whole dialog.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2fwo", "ups": 3, "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5yq2b", "retrieved_on": 1427425911, "id": "c02abra", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02abra", "parent_id": "t1_c02ab3a", "body": "Oh, good grief. \n\nListen: this is Reddit.
