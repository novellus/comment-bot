Obviously, given the nature of how Wpoison actually works, it can easily be seen that (unless something is done to prevent it) the evil spammer address harvesting web crawlers may get trapped by Wpoison (as intended) but that then, they might begin to access your installed copy of Wpoison over and over again (as intended) perhaps even to such an extent that they end up using up most/all of your available CPU cycles and/or most/all of your available network bandwidth.\n\n&gt;This problem also was solved in a fairly trivial and straightforward way. In a nutshell, just prior to the time it generates the very tail end of any one of its randomly-generated pseudo web pages, Wpoison pauses for several seconds. It just does nothing (other than wasting time) during those several seconds.
