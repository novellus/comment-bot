How can a rescue effort in one area be such a fiasco, while in another be relatively smooth? Corruption and incompetence on the ground. Nagin never used the school buses he had on hand to move people out of the lower 9th -- either because he didn't know he had them (incompetence) or because he wanted to bring more money to the city in disaster relief. I lean toward incompetence, as I don't think too many people could be that callous. \n\nThe converse is the response in CA where a plan is in place for just these very conditions. Like hurricanes in the Gulf, fires in CA are a regular occurrence. The folks in CA have created a plan of evacuation, food and lodging for the evacuated, as well as property protection in the face of the fires. NOLA may have had the same thing, but either they didn't practice it, didn't believe the weather reports, or weren't able to enact the response. Fingers pointed at the President, but he really had nothing to do with it -- it was the responsibility of the mayor and governor to make those granular decisions.
