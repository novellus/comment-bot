Dobson consciously resisted the elevation of women to the inner circle of senior leadership during the entire decade I worked with him. \r\n      Our executive team was exclusively white and male and Jim spoke openly about the exclusion of women from that group.\" p. 145 \r\n\r\n\r\n      \"This lack of sensitivity and vision for inclusion, specifically for the value of including women in the workplace decision-making process is, in my view, a significant piece of evidence in evaluating Dobson's sexism. We have here an old-fashioned, male traditionalist who simply believes in masculine leadership, as have men with power throughout history. He overtly advocates male leadership with regard to the Christian family and he functions in exactly the same way with regard to the office, as if he believes there is a divine order in which men are ordained to lead corporations.\" p. 147 \r\n\r\n      \"Yet another example of this aspect of Jim's value system was brought to my attention by my wife, Carolyn, based on her experience processing listener mail at focus. One day she told me of a correspondence policy that Focus on the Family used regarding how we addressed female constituents when we wrote back to them. \r\n      Members of Carolyn's department were instructed by policy that if married women wrote to Focus on the Family, regardless of how they signed their name, if their donation check, their stationery, their return address, or the body of the text gave us the name of their husband, our return letter was to be addressed to \"Mrs. (husband's first name) (husband's last name).\" This meant that if Mrs. Deborah Smith wrote to us and it was clear she was married to Mr. John Smith, then our staff was to address her return letter to \"Mrs. John Smith,\" not \"Mrs. Deborah Smith.\" Carolyn pointed out to me the dilemmas created by this policy, not only the general disrespect it can sometimes convey but several specific problems that seemed extremely insensitive. I was shown a letter, for example, from a woman who wrote Focus on the Family asking for advice and encouraging books or tapes we might be able to send back to help her through the painful experience of her husband recently leaving her for another woman. Our staff was forced by Focus policy to address that woman by her husband's first and last name. \r\n\r\n      I recall vividly the moment when I presented this problem to our weekly executive staff meeting and made the recommendation that we change our naming policy. It became one of several moments toward the end of my working relationship with Jim where a silent alarm sounded deep in my consciousness signaling that my ability to work with James Dobson was coming to an end. In my presentation I told my fellow executives the story that I had learned from Carolyn. I expected concern and support for the woman abandoned by her husband who would be addressed by that man's name when we wrote back to her. To my surprise, no one in the room supported my concerns. Not one Focus leader. \r\n\r\n      Jim personally led the opposition. There was an aggressive edge to Jim's voice as he opposed Carolyn's perspective on women. He was upset with my critique of a naming protocol that he himself had established. Jim attempted to explain why addressing women by their husband's name was a traditional and acceptable concept and that he was opposed to the efforts by the women's movement to discredit that tradition. Clearly, it had never crossed his mind, whether, if traditional roles were reversed, he might be uncomfortable being addressed as \"Dear Mr. Shirley Deere.\" Included in Jim's remarks that afternoon was his routine opposition to titling women \"Ms.\" It was clear that the extreme example I had offered - an abandoned woman being addressed by her husband's name - made on impression on Jim whatsoever.

I wasn't really suggesting you were crazy, and I think most people could tell by the light-hearted, sort of silly way that I said it, that I wasn't attacking you.\r\n\r\nI thought the right wing fundies were supposed to be the touchy, don't-get-jokes types.\r\n\r\nOh yeah, and I didn't suggest you should check with your doctor to see if you were crazy because you disagreed with me, I said that because you were spouting off some conspiracy theory about the religious right is \"about making girls feel that their sexuality is the property of the males around them.\"  That's crazy.\r\n\r\n&gt;It's one of the hazards of Web 3.0, especially for people with limited life experience or education. People think that the ease of posting their opinion over and over somehow validates their opinions more than research or evidence.\r\n\r\nThis is called an [ad hominem attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem).  I learned that in college.\r\n\r\n&gt;you've spent what, 2-3 hours just this weekend vehemently defending those who DO from having anyone point out the logical and expected consequences of their actions.\r\n\r\nNo, I probably wasted it arguing with you and no one is watching this thread anymore.  But I spent it trying to explain to someone who believes in vast conspiracies that it is really a simple thing.  People who are pro-life believe that unborn children are human beings and abortion is killing them.  They don't have a secret \"anti-woman\" agenda.\r\n\r\nThey don't want men or women engaging in irresponsible sex and using abortion for after-the-fact birth control.\r\n\r\nI believe that pro-choice individuals use strange conspiracy theories to try and take people's eye off that simple message.\r\n\r\n&gt;So you're in favor of abortion for contraceptive failure, then? For cases of rape and incest?\r\n\r\nSee, that's where you made your mistake in lumping me in with the religious right.  You've conveniently ignored the fact that I have repeatedly emphasized that I do not have a religious basis for my beliefs, purely a logical one.\r\n\r\nI don't personally give a crap if you want to kill your unborn child, or your infant child.  Just don't mess with MY child.  But on a purely logical level, my position is that we do not know if abortion is killing innocent human beings.  So we should do everything reasonable to reduce the number of abortions.\r\n\r\n\"Cases of rape\" that result in pregnancy are exceedingly rare and really only of use to people who argue for abortion because it conjures up a strong emotional picture, but rarely actually happens. So I don't have a problem with it.\r\n\r\nAnd cases of actual contraceptive failure are also exceedingly rare.  Most contraceptives, if used properly by an intelligent human being are upwards of 98% effective.  So again, in my view of \"reducing abortions to a minimum\" it wouldn't be a problem.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that people will continue behave irresponsibly and then be surprised when they are pregnant because they are idiots and then want abortions and lie about it.\r\n\r\n&gt;But if the woman WAS too \"lazy\" to take birth control, and she'll die without an abortion, tough luck to her. Is that her just desserts?\r\n\r\nWell, if I'm too \"careless\" to look over my shoulder when merging in traffic and a semi runs me over, I may die. Life is full of consequences for the careless and lazy.\r\n\r\n&gt;What about the women in abusive relationships where her partner uses coercion to prevent her from taking birth control or actively sabotages birth-control? (Sadly, most teenagers who become pregnant, are impregnated by adult males, and manyt become pregnant in just such a scenario.) Is she entitled to an abortion?\r\n\r\nI'm going to ask for a source on that before I debate it.  I know, you probably already posted a source to this in some other thread in reddit and expect me to go hunt it down, but I have this crazy thing about posting sources to statements you make in the actual thread that you make them.

This year, that same woman was fired because \"the Bible\" forbids women to teach men or have authority over them. Her gender didn't suddenly change. The Bible didn't suddenly change. What changed is the Religious Right's attitude toward women.\r\n\r\nYou apparently aren't old enough to remember the 1960s or the early 1970s. I am. You never heard the misogynist rhetoric from the pulpit back then that you hear today.\r\n\r\nWhy? Because back then they were still  confidentally asserting that black people were ordained by God to be the \"servants of servants\"; the Brown vs. the Board of Education was \"wrongly decided\" and that interracial marriage was a sin.\r\n\r\nOnce they couldn't get away with treating black people like this anymore, they turned to women. Nature abhors a vaccum. \r\n\r\n&gt;I use basic logic to arrive at my position\r\n\r\nYet you claimed that it's \"counter-intuitive\" to describe interventions to increase the rate of unwanted pregancies as efforts to keep the abortion rate high.\r\n\r\nIs it always Opposite Day where you live?\r\n\r\n&gt;I don't want to hold women down or discriminate against them.  \r\n\r\nYet you've spent what, 2-3 hours just this weekend vehemently defending those who DO  from having anyone point out the logical and expected consequences of their actions.\r\n\r\n&gt;I'd just like to see men and women use more PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY when it comes to birth control and quit taking the chance that they are killing untold innocent children each year because they are too lazy to take a birth control pill or use a condom or one of the many other very-effective methods of birth control.\r\n\r\nSo you're in favor of abortion for contraceptive failure, then?

Anti-choice women often expect special treatment from clinic staff. Some demand an abortion immediately, wanting to skip important preliminaries such as taking a history or waiting for blood test results. Frequently, anti-abortion women will refuse counseling (such women are generally turned away or referred to an outside counselor because counseling at clinics is mandatory). Some women insist on sneaking in the back door and hiding in a room away from other patients. Others refuse to sit in the waiting room with women they call \"sluts\" and \"trash.\" Or if they do, they get angry when other patients in the waiting room talk or laugh, because it proves to them that women get abortions casually, for \"convenience\". \r\n\r\nhttp://www.guttmacher.org/media/nr/prabort2.html\r\n\r\n&gt;one in five women having abortions are born-again or Evangelical Christians\r\nhttp://www.guttmacher.org/media/nr/prabort2.html\r\n\r\nhttp://mypage.direct.ca/w/writer/anti-tales.html\r\n\r\n&gt;24% of women who had abortions considered the procedure morally wrong, and 7% of women who'd had abortions disagreed with the statement, \"Any woman who wants an abortion should be permitted to obtain it legally.\" \r\n\r\nHenshaw, S.K. and G.
