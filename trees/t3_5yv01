Bernoulli's simply allows us to create more efficient wings, and hence get better flight characteristics, and more fuel efficiency. \n\nIt's unclear to me how this myth began. It should be obvious to anyone who has ever considered the issue, that lift generated by faster air over the top of the wing can not create much upwards lift. Those people who are glider pilots (I am!) know full well, that bernoulli allows you to push the glide ratio (Lift/Drag, or LD for short) to around 60:1, but that is in an exceedingly efficient $100,000 carbon and kevlar glider...\n\nA glider manages to do it because the wing angle of attack is correct for a device that generates a lot of lift (Long narrow wings are better than short fat ones) and has no engine. If you turn the engines off in a jet, you have to pitch over and get the nose down to prevent stalling. This is because in level flight the jet pushes more air downwards than is required to keep the plane aloft. The Drag escalates due to this, and that's what the engines overcome: the extra drag of pushing all that air down, and why it'll stall quickly if not powered the whole time.\n\nJets can still glide quite well, but not anywhere near the 60:1 of a glider/sailplane. Jets can make about 10:1 from memory - not bad for a thing weighing hundreds of tons.  ", "author_flair_css_class": null}

My error was not in admitting Newtons Third Law as a source of lift, but in denying Bernoulli's Principle.\n\nI believe you have made the same error. We cannot really say that Lift is caused by X, or even that it is caused more by X than Y. The fact that X can often be derived from or composed of Y is the rigor that makes both X and Y true and therefore both \"responsible\" for lift. How much faith would you put in the Coanda effect if it violated Newton's laws? Since Bernoulli's Principle can be derived from Newton's laws it IS correct and can be useful to our understanding of lift, as can the Coanda effect. Any assertion that X causes lift is both highly absurd, strangely defendable, and often useful. If I maintain that density 'causes' lift I can prove that wings do not work in space - true and useful. Should I really use the word 'cause' to describe the relationship between lift and density? Same argument for the Coanda effect.

Oh, but lift can not occur if density is zero so density causes lift. Sigh. . .\n\nAnyway, there is a relation between Newton's Laws and Bernoulli's Principle that always holds.

This doesn't mean the Coanda effect doesn't exist on airfoils, just that there's more going on than the coanda effect. A lot more.\n\nThe Coanda effect depends on laminar flow in the boundary layer. The thickness of this layer is determined by the ratio of inertial to viscous forces in the fluid. Air is dominated by inertial forces at the speed airplanes fly so although the Coanda effect exists, it is not the reason an airplane flies.\n\nThe Coanda effect is a result of viscosity. If I said the Coanda effect didn't exist I would be pretending viscosity didn't exist. Does that really mean that the Coanda effect is responsible for lift? Well. . .
