The European Parliament has repeatedly passed resolutions requesting an immediate moratorium on the further use of depleted uranium ammunition, but **France and Britain \u2013 the only EU states that are also permanent members of the United Nations Security Council** \u2013 have consistently rejected calls for a ban, maintaining that its use continues to be legal, and that the health risks are entirely unsubstantiated. \r\n\r\nThe only scientists who claim it is \"safe\" \r\nare the RAND scientists, who are brought to you by the Department of Defense. \r\nAlso, analysis of Depleted Uranium is discussed in its \"sitting in the other room\"\r\nform, not when its the primary component of a large bullet that shatters and creates millions of airborne particles. Thus all talk about the safety of DU has to be discussed with the safety of breathing in DU particles near where DU ammunition is fired and/or impacts.", "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": "t3_5z9be", "ups": 1, "author_flair_css_class": null}
