This is the price the Democrats must forever pay for their Faustian bargain in supporting conservative Democratic candidates.  And now that they are in office, the Democrats are stuck with them. And since they ran as moderate conservatives their districts expect them to vote that way!  The Democrats just added 40 more members to their bluedog problems.   This is rich with irony.
