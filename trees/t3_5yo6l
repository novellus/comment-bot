I will say 3 things:\n\n1- The falling dollar makes the oil more expensive... in US dollars.\n\n2- OPEC controls 40% of Oil production, they have control on prices only because demand is not flexible at all. There is no short-term alternative to Oil.\n\n3- Supply is not that flexible either, and new supply comes from places like Alberta, where production costs are around 50$ a barrel (and this number is going up, there is a lot of inflation in Alberta). If the last barrel is produced at a cost of 50-60$, Oil price can't go below 70-80$.\n\nThere is no conspiracy, it's supply and demand at work.", "author": "ratzero", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c02a9vw", "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qgzg", "name": "t1_c02a9vw", "parent_id": "t3_5yo6l", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}
