If it's only the amount of discretionary spending, why not specify it?  To get whatever 52% figure, you have to narrow the numbers down in some very selective way.

The fedgov has had to pour a crapload into the Iraq sinkhole just to barely keep the defense outlays in line with total federal expenditures.
