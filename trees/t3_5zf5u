Starting from Imphal on October 22, these energetic men belonging to the Royal Riders of Manipur traversed Nagaland, Assam, Mizoram and Arunachal before reaching Shillong on October 27. The tour, christened as the One North East Campaign, will end on October 30.", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qgzy", "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": "t3_5zf5u", "ups": 1, "author_flair_css_class": null}
