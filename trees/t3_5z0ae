Growing up it just seemed like a bad accent used by people that couldn't speak correctly.\n\nMost of my classmates in high school that spoke it seemed to do so out of laziness rather than merely being used to it. That is, their grades were universally bad, not just in English classes. (I doubt it has anything to do with the English that the teachers spoke.) \n\n(FYI: I didn't realize that my use of the Acronym \"SAE\" could be interpreted as \"Southern American English\", I meant it as \"Standard American English\" prior to this.)\n\n&gt; Neither. You seem unable to accept that AAVE is not \"broken\" SAE. AAVE is a completely separate dialect that is based on SAE. It has its own rules that are different from the rules of SAE, but those rules are consistent within AAVE.\n\nAnecdotally, I don't think any of the Ebonics speakers I knew actually considered Ebonics a legitimate dialect of English. (Should they?) For example, I had a driver's ed class where one \"gangsta\" student criticized a girl for using the word \"vague\". I don't recall exactly what he said, but it was something along the lines of \"The fuck? Vague? Why you tryin' to sound all smart and shit?\"\n\nI suppose it's because the differences seem so minimal that saying it's somehow different and correct on its own seems like a poor attempt at political correctness rather than an attempt at honest scientific legitimacy. Perhaps it's also because it seems to classify and give an air of distance, formality and exoticism to something that seems to be the antithesis of all of those, especially given how different dialects tend to be, such as Cantonese from Chinese. Regardless, it's not that I'm not willing to \"accept it\", just that there's a lot of things about what you're saying that are legitimately confusing.\n\nTo elaborate further, perhaps I should ask you: if someone speaks a mixture of AAVE and Standard American English, are they speaking broken versions of both? It seems like what you're describing only allows for full-on versions of both of them.\n\nLastly, one question about regional variation: [this link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAVE#Grammatical_features) says that \"He's about to go to work\" is \"He finna go to work\", but I've *never* seen a person use \"finna\", only \"gonna\".

One doesn't apply the rules of their dialect because they have a checklist of rules that they refer to.  They use whatever \"sounds right\".\n\nThe other part of my point was, if you don't know what the rules of AAVE are (and didn't grow up speaking it), then how do know if they're being used consistently?\n\n&gt;speakers don't consistently follow those rules because it is an inherently rebellious dialect.\n\nSee, I disagree with that.  Most speakers of AAVE grow up hearing it in their home.  To them, there's no sense of rebelliousness.  They speak it with their family and friends.\n\nIf AAVE is rebellious, then so is Southern American English (I've seen several \"rednecks\" on Cops getting in trouble with the law while speaking Souther English, after all).\n\n&gt;One issue that makes me confused is that, as you go down the ladder of education, it seems that AAVE is more common. \n\nI'll agree with that observation.  However, it's mostly because, the more educated one is, the more likely they are to see the social benefits of using a standard dialect, and the more they'll want to separate themselves from being grouped with the \"ganstas\" and \"thugs\" just because of the way they talk.\n\n&gt;For example, I'd hear sentences like \"Nigga we be gettin' some of that dro tonight\" at a school I went to, which just seems like a broken version of \"Nigga, we're getting some of that dro tonight.\"\n\nBut it's *not* a broken version of the standard dialect.  That usage is *correct* in AAVE.  It was derived from SAE and African influences.  For example, the usage of \"be\" in that sentence indicates a habitual form of the verb, meaning that they're planning to \"get some of that dro\" tonight, as they tend to do on a regular basis.  If they had instead said \"Nigga we gettin' some of that dro tonight\", then it would indicate that the action was *not* habitual.\n\n&gt;Would Ebonics only be used at the lowest tier of education--that is, virtually no knowledge of SAE grammar rules--or does it apply to all usages of broken SAE?\n\nNeither.  You seem unable to accept that AAVE is *not* \"broken\" SAE.  AAVE is a completely separate dialect that is *based* on SAE.  It has its own rules that are different from the rules of SAE, but those rules are consistent within AAVE.\n\n&gt;I don't really have the time nor the inclination/desire to go and look at each one of those sources.\n\nI'm in the same boat.

For example, it is alleged that the copula (am, are, is, etc.) is omitted in AAE--carelessly left out, critics seem to imply--or incorrectly used in the uninflected form \"be.\" This is a jumble of falsehoods. The rules regarding the AAE copula are quite detailed and specific. If it bears stress, as it always does at the end of a phrase, it must be pronounced; thus it is obligatory in \"Couldn't nobody say what color he is,\" meaning \"Nobody could say what color he is\" (examples in this paragraph are from the utterances of Larry, a speaker studied by William Labov(5)). If the copula is negated, it cannot be omitted; it is pronounced \"ain't,\" as in \"You ain't goin' to no heaven\" (\"You aren't going to any heaven\"). There is a special habitual aspect that standard English lacks, and for this \"be\" is used and must never be omitted; \"they be sayin' \" means \"they habitually say.\" The copula is also obligatory when it is in the past tense. Only when the AAE copula is not marking habitual aspect, not negated, not stressed, and in the present tense can it be unpronounced (\"he good\" means \"he's good\"). Russian, Hungarian, and other languages have a very similar rule.

Cosby's remarks about black people are intended for OTHER BLACK PEOPLE.  They are usually used, however, by white people to make themselves feel good about not liking black people.  \n\nI once saw Chris Rock talking about how he sometimes wished he never did his \"the difference between black people and niggers\" routine because all the people who tell him they like that routine are white, and that wasn't hist intended audience.  \n\nIan MacKaye of the band Minor Threat said the same thing about their song \"guilty of being white.\"  It was intended for the small audience of white kids at his high school who were beaten up regularly by black students just for being white, but when the band became widely listened to it was reinterpreted into a white supremacist message that's the exact opposite of what he hoped people would get out of it.\n\nSo there's that.  \n\nSecondly, while no one can deny that the \"black community\" (whatever the hell that is) has problems, white people have, in fact, pretty systematically screwed over black people and other minority groups for hundreds of years.  Slavery, yes, obviously, but also things like redlining, FHA regulations, housing covenants, segregation laws, housing projects, etc.  While that doesn't wipe the slate clean for black people it sure just isn't as easy as \"stop blaming white people.\"  99% of the white people I know (and I'm white so I know a lot) HATE black people (and most other minorities) when you get them talking about it.  I'm sure the same goes for many black people in regards to whites, as well.   Until we can deal with the messed up structure of our society AND people's prejudice we're going to have problems that can't be solved by talking in a certain way.\n\nSilly debates about \"Ebonics\" aside, Cosby SERIOUSLY simplified what is, in actuality, a very complex issue.
