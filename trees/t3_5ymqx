The fundamental concept behind most video games requires some stretching of the imagination. Let's face it. If a guy with a gun is being attacked by more than one person with guns, he's probably going to end up dead. Yet in video games and movies, the reverse ninja rule applies and he'll kill them all. Doom is a classic example. The player would go down the first time they were hit by a bullet. No first aid kit is going to let you continue to walk around looking like swiss cheese. Some games have a mythology to explain it away. Vampires heal quickly. You have an energy shielded suit. Stats are for your shield. I kind of like the bullet time concept for supernatural/super power games.", "author": "snookums", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "id": "c02a5tq", "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh03", "name": "t1_c02a5tq", "parent_id": "t1_c02a2xj", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "gaming", "ups": 2, "name": "t1_c02a2xj", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5ymqx", "retrieved_on": 1427426025, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02a2xj", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02a0dv", "body": "In games of accuracy or reaction time (which is most of them), a basic bot will be much deadlier than any human, and will need to be dumbed down to provide a meaningful challenge.\n\nJust like a Tic-Tac-Toe AI needs to be dumbed down, because the game is trivial to solve completely and an AI can play the game \"perfectly\", either winning or forcing a draw in every game, never losing.
