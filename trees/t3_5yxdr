Solar power is dear because silicon photocells are dear. Which is frustrating because they can use brighter light than the 1kW per square meter that the sun provides. If the sun were brighter, solar power would be cheaper.\n\nOne idea is to use mirrors to concentrate the sun's rays. Use a steerable parabolic dish to concentrate the suns rays thus getting more electricity out of your expensive silicon. That works well until the wind catches your parabolic dish and breaks the mechanism.\n\nVersion two is much stronger, but that pushes the price back up.\n\nThe article is about Version Three. Use an inflatable ball. Transparent on the sun side, except for the solar panel, which is facing the wrong way, and mirrored on the inside of the other side. Sunlight comes through the ball and is reflected and concentrated onto the solar cell.\n\nWill this really be a price break-through? The article tells you less than my summary :-(", "author": "AlanCrowe", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "gilded": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5yxdr", "id": "c02au94", "author_flair_css_class": null}
