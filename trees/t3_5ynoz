But they also supplied false gossip that contradicted that evidence.\n\n--\n\nI have to question the methodology.  They gave a group of students false gossip about other players, yet at that point, the students had no factual information contradicting the gossip.  They had access to other's notes, but no way to differentiate between which notes were factual and which were gossip.\n\nThen, it looks from the article as though they gave *the same group of students* access to factual information about other players' choices along with gossip.  Yet, didn't this group already have exposure to prior gossip?\n\nHad they taken into account the phenomenon of self-fulfilling prophecy such that at that point students had already chosen to interpret other's actions in a way to confirm existing opinions based on gossip?  I think they should have started a new game with new students. \n\n", "author": "bithead", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c02a2ej", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "name": "t1_c02a2ej", "parent_id": "t3_5ynoz", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}
