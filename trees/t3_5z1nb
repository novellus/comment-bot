The amortized performance proofs are complicated but the pseudo-code is fairly simple, though I assume you've already been through that ad nauseam so I won't attempt to recreate it.\n\nIf you don't \"see it\" from going through pseudo-code (and I'd be impressed if you could), about the only way to really explain it is to go through each step of a non-trivial splay on a whiteboard, redrawing the tree at each stage and not erasing as you go.  There are various visualization applets that cover splay trees but they generally do not show the before and after on each step or let you reverse the process and see what's changing.  I remember having to do this manually for splay trees, Fibonacci heaps, and other such complex data structures.  I found it helpful to trace the path of one or two nodes through the whole process in another color.
