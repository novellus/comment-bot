Nice try.\n\nThe video you link to has been removed, but I've seen it before. Ron Paul goes out of his way to say that he thinks 9/11 should be investigated NOT because he thinks it was some conspiracy but because he wants to expose how the CIA and FBI had all kinds of clues laying around (and had one hijacker in custody) months ahead of time but because of their enormous, bungling bureaucracy they were unable to connect the dots and prevent the attacks. He does NOT believe in conspiracy, he believes that big government bureaucracy is incompetent, which is completely consistent with the rest of his views.\n\nRon Paul just wants government to leave people alone, and bigots and racist haters are now a tiny minority in this country so it's not surprising that they just want to be left alone. If we're practicing guilt by association, why not credit by association? All the geniuses in Silicon Valley are lining up behind Ron Paul, he has more Silicon Valley donations than any other candidate.\n", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "politics", "ups": -7, "name": "t1_c029s1d", "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5yjkt", "retrieved_on": 1427426168, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c029s1d", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c029s02", "body": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "created_utc": "1192669414", "name": "t1_c029sbo", "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5yjkt", "retrieved_on": 1427426163, "score": 3, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c029sbo", "author": "[deleted]", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "politics", "ups": 3, "parent_id": "t1_c029s02", "body": "&gt;you can see that they are pretty uniformly good.\r\n\r\nSounds like you've already made up your mind without discussion.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "name": "t1_c029s02", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 1, "link_id": "t3_5yjkt", "retrieved_on": 1427426168, "body": "[deleted]", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "parent_id": "t3_5yjkt", "id": "c029s02", "author_flair_css_class": null}
