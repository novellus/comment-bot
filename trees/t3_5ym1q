E.g. do Indian voters care about the effect their politico-economic process has on US IT-jobs? I do not think so. You? Therefore, to stick to the Iraq-war example, Americans should decide whether to pull out or not based on their own interest, not based on what is good or not for the Iraqi (or, as some would say, Israeli) population.
