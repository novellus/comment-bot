They are the only nuclear power in the region, and they have made it clear they will start a nuclear war if necessary rather than see parity with some other state in the region.  This means they can continue to do as they please, invade whatever nation they choose, whenever they choose, as well as dictate the conditions that the Palestinian people are to live under, including, most importantly, where they can live.\n\nThis means that Palestine continues to shrink, while Israel continues to grow.
