Please tell me where you're getting your facts that the mortality rate of SLAVES and the infant death rate rate was lower than people who live in a free modern society, I've GOT to see them. I can refer to several hundred texts on the real plight of slaves.  Plus the fact that I was born in Mississippi where we have slave museums and the after effects of it still permeates the culture there lets me think I have a bit more of a perspective of it than you.  shit man some of the old plantations are still standing now in the delta region of that state.
