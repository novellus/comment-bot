In principle it's an open standard, you can create your own groupware server and use it with Outlook instead of MS Exchange. In practice, it has an incredible amount of accidental complexity which makes it impossible to clone properly.\n\nI was in the Outlook group in 1995-1997. MS Had then two good implementations of MAPI, The personal storage, .pst files, and Exchange server. Already their subtle differences made writing portable code difficult, imagine a third party attempting to create an interface, when MS's own  MAPI Implementations of MS-mail and Lotus notes we're quite incomplete for serious work. \n\nThe huge mistake of both MAPI and IMAP is complexity. The spec is useless, quirks of the first system became the unofficial standard. You can make one proprietary system working that way, not two. \n\nSMTP is actually simple, and that's why it works across the board. POP is not as simple,  but works too. IMAP does not. At least by my experience it's unusable. \n\nMy hope is, that this Google IMAP implementation becomes the unofficial standard that everyone has to test against. Maybe then, IMAP actually could became an alternative to browser based groupware.\n\nThe referred [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAPI) has a confusing statement 'MAPI is closely related to MAPI/RPC'. The MAPI/RPC is just one implementation of MAPI, not any part of the standard. \n", "id": "c02bozh", "author": "hoijarvi", "created_utc": "1193515354", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2fwo", "name": "t1_c02bozh", "parent_id": "t1_c02bort", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "programming", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 22, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5z94g", "retrieved_on": 1427425205, "id": "c02bort", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02bort", "parent_id": "t3_5z94g", "body": "&gt; IMAP lost long, long ago to MAPI for client/server communication protocols.\n\nreally?  what the hell is MAPI?", "author_flair_css_class": null}
