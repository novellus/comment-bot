Different breeds of dogs have different average intelligence, as do different breeds of cats. It would follow that the same would be true of other mammals, including humans._  Presupposing of course that \"intelligence\" in humans is a single, unidimensional phenomenon that is purely biological in its origin.\n\nI have great respect for Watson's work in molecular genetics. But his perspective on politics is naive, as are his assumptions about complex psychosocial phenomena.\n\nThis repost is just race-baiting.", "author": "slomo68", "created_utc": "1193198759", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5yzf3", "id": "c02az0p", "author_flair_css_class": null}
