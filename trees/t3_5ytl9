XP Pro, which is now almost seven yeas old, has generated untold billiosn for Microsoft, is sold for $150. Good deal.\n2. That is the very reason Windows sucks, the cheap and shoddy hardware/drivers.\n3. The reason why some programs are Windows only is because Microsoft strong-armed them into it. Especially in the video industry, where Microsoft actively threatened companies like Macromedia and Adobe *not* to support Quicktime. Apple's Final Cut Pro was originally developed by Macromedia, but they had to ditch it because of Microsoft. If you think that the only \"big software deal\" is iLife, you are clearly a) not looking very carefully b) willfully ignoring the evidence.\n4. Again with the games, it seems like that is the only argument pc enthusiasts can come up with, and that only because of MS lock-in.\n5. I don't care about obscure gadgets. In this day and age, if a company wants to introduce something new and shiny, they'd better make damn sure it works on the Mac. Take a look at the early adopters of the iPhone to see how many gadget freaks are Apple lovers.\n6. No argument here. I have XP lying around for Inventor 2008 and some other things, but I hardly ever use it.\n7. Granted, some fanbois can be quite irritating, but the again, Windows people spouting bilious mis-information and lies is not a pretty sight either: \"Hey, you only have one mouse-button, right, Apple is the suxxorz!!!\"\n\nNow, I understand that people have different needs and desires of their OS/Platform, and if Windows is what makes you happy, then go for it. You certainly have more choice and better support. But there are some upsides to the Mac. I for one do not enjoy Windows, never have and in all likelihood, never will.

Whether or not you play them is irrelevant, because there are millions of other PC gamers to your thousands that play WoW.  DirectX is never moving past Windows and that's that.\n\n5.
