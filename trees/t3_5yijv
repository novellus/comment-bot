In addition, such would cost 100s of $1000s. If not more.\n\nYou can try to do it yourself, but the expenses are great. You need to employ a team of dozens, some of which sit around doing nothing but posting all day, to sites much more obscure than reddit. To even know which sites to target requires expertise that new hires won't have. You have to have them post from multiple internet connections, which costs money.\n\nThink some comcast ijit technician won't gossip, if he has to set up 20 cable modems in some sort of boiler room, and he met the verizon dsl people there at the same time, setting up 20 more connections?
