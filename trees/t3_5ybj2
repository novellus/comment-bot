Before I switched to Linux (topical because I have stopped using my computer as a gaming machine and play games on consoles now), I had at least 20 games installed that I hadn't paid for, and a few of them were notorious for their crippling DRM.  What is really sad is that the games that had the worst DRM were the least popular games.  It seems like the better the game was the less intrusive the DRM was (if any was present).  \n\nAlso, while I won't justify pirating software, this issue is just like the music and movie industry.
