One even insisted repeatedly to our class that there's no reason we shouldn't put a cap on how much money anyone can make. \n\nThe traditional american viewpoint is pretty clearly anti-big government and pro-freedom; I don't know of a single teacher I had in high school or college which didn't either support the crap we have now or support switching over to socialism and being more reliant on government for everything.   \n\nHaving government employees teach you about history and government, just doesn't make any sense regardless of how you look at it. Even if there are some great teachers, that doesn't mean there's not a clear problem with the system.
