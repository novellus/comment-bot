Even in areas where there's not a lot of smog there's just too much light from building signs and bright white street lights. Although, if you ever happen to find yourself out in the country at night, take the time to look up. I used to have an astronomy teacher who showed us the Astronomy Picture of the Day at the beginning of every class and to this day sights like this still blow my mind.
