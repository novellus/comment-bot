I'm tired of the hyberbole on the part of those who just want \"sensible\" laws for everything under the sun.  The taxpayers don't want to just be \"sensible,\" and pay for those who can't be bothered to come into the country legally.\n\nDon't get me wrong - my cousin married a girl from Romania, who lives with him in the US now.  She came here legally, and I welcome her.  The US was founded on immigration, though some of those immigrants weren't real nice to the native peoples.  But I digress, and feel no more shame for what far previous generations of my ancestors might have done than I feel that modern African-Americans deserve \"reparations\" for what someone else did to them a long long long time ago.\n\nThe point is, those who break the law to get into the country have already proven that they're not law-abiding.  It doesn't matter to me WHERE they come from.  And yes, like the article talks about, they probably CAN be \"rehabilitated,\" though that's every bit the made up word to me that it is to Morgan Freeman's character in *The Shawshank Redemption*: we can deport them from the country, and in 10 years - or whatever the current law states the waiting time is - they're welcome to apply to come in legally.\n\nTo take a paragraph out of the article: \"The paralysis in Congress and the country over fixing our immigration laws stems from our inability to get our heads around the wrenching change involved in making an illegal person legal. Think of doing that with a crime, like cocaine dealing or arson. Unthinkable!\"  See, these sensible laws that social liberals push for *ARE* unthinkable.  I wouldn't let an arsonist stay in society if he promised to reform himself, I'd send him to jail where he needs to be, for a period of time that would convince me that he's \"rehabilitated.\"  We don't need to jail those here illegally, either - that means we pay for their food, healthcare, etc. until they \"prove\" they're good by sitting in a jail cell for a certain amount of time.  No, I wouldn't want to pay for it, and would deport them.  Society shouldn't pay for it either, and our laws specifically call for deportation and a waiting period for a reason.", "author": "jadecristal", "created_utc": "1193644042", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "archived": true, "subreddit": "politics", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5zb5z", "id": "c02bx39", "author_flair_css_class": null}
