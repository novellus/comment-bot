It's very frustrating.\n\nThis is bigger than Ubuntu.  I've been having problems on FC7 also.  I was able to get my Atheros cards working by adding a rfkill=0 parameter to the madwifi module, but I cannot use NetworkManager.  It also takes a few tries to properly associate with APs and get an IP address from DHCP.\n\nI've tried multiple cards and multiple access points with the same results.  If you turn off encryption, then everything works perfectly.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
