But although the pieces don't perfectly fit together in the official theory, the sanest of the other conspiracy theories have missing pieces too, or some pieces out of line.\n\nThe 'official' conspiracy theory of the 9-11 Commission Report is that Al Qaeda and the Saudi Arabian Osama Bin Laden (formally supported and funded by the CIA) conspired with a number of other people (17 of which were Saudi Arabian) to hijack American airliners and crash them into 4 targets.\n\nAnd yet the Commission Report doesn't even follow the source of funding which is the most important thing.\n ", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "name": "t1_c02a1i7", "parent_id": "t1_c02a0tq", "ups": 1, "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "name": "t1_c02a0tq", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5ymdi", "retrieved_on": 1427426053, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02a0tq", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "parent_id": "t3_5ymdi", "body": "What I love about the 9/11 conspiracies is just how insane and illogical the arguments have become.

Let's assume for a second there was a conspiracy by Bush to blow up the WTC.  So you're going to pull off this conspiracy to kill thousands of Americans and as part of the plan you decide 'Oh yeah, we should make sure make FEMA is on the ground before the attack.' For what possible reason?! \n\nInsanity, it's like arguing with flat earthers or creationists.
