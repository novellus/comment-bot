It's sort of vague, unrelated straw-man argument, punctuated with levity.  \n\nHowever, I think I'll address some of what you are saying.  \n\nIf a person has homosexual relations for kicks, or to \"figure themselves out\" or because of a drunken dare, or they wanted to experiment, that does not make them a homosexual.  A man can have sex with a woman and still be gay.  Therefore a man can have sex with a man and still be straight.  Granted, it isn't likely, but that's besides the point.  \n\nAs for the counseling argument (which this comment all grandfathers from, and I assume was the target of your post), you will notice that they are counseling homos to become heteros.  That's the argument.  Not people who have \"grazed on the other side of the fence\", not Switch-Hitters, or whatever.  Honest to goodness Homos, converted to Heteros.  That, good sir, is as impossible as the reverse.  \n\nAs for declaring a lack of interest in Gay Sex... I have a pair of homosexual friends that do not have gay sex.  They refer to themselves as \"non-practicing gays\".  Notice, despite not wanting Man Sex, they are ~still homosexuals~.  This is because they still desire members of their gender.  That's it.  That's all.  They do not need to be active to be declared.  \n\nNow, as for the Continuum comment...  yes, sexuality is a diverse banquet of options and possibilities.  I never suggested otherwise.    Have you ever heard of the Kinsey scale?  It may not be accurate so much these days, but it certainly is suggestive of sexuality being something non-binary.  \n\nSo, if you are addressing my original points, I would like to restate them for comprehension purposes:\nif this church claims to be able to cure homosexuals and convert them into heterosexuals, then they are lying.  What they are doing is harmful.  The homosexuals in question who would avail themselves of this service need to learn acceptance, not how to lie to others and to themselves.  Sexuality is not a decision.  \n\nThe journey of sexuality, the experiments, the adventures, that's choice.  You can try the other side.  You can see if leather floats your boat.  Go for it.  Have a blast.  But ultimately, you will come to a rest somewhere.  That place of rest, that's your sexuality.
