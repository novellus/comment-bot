The model is behind the fire station. They're quite proud of it, it seems.\r\nIf there was anyone inside that thing, they couldn't have been much taller that 18\" or so. My guess, given the year, is this was a mock-up for a MOAB bomb (Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb). Nowdays, this bomb looks nothing like the \"bell\" that the Keksberg citizens got a gander at before the military and NASA hauled it away-- but the first images ever released to the public definitely showed a bell shape. The best example of the earlier model MOAB would have to be from the film, \"Hot Zone\", with Dustin Hoffman as the bumbling hero doctor. At the opening of the film, we see a large airplane flying over the jungle with a large bell-shaped object hanging by a rope. The sick men in the clearing all cheer, thinking this container holds much needed meds. As the bell is released and drifts their way, it dawns on them that they've been screwed. \r\n\r\nThis bomb was used once during the first Gulf War against entrenched lines. British commandos acting as forward observers later reported that the explosion was so huge they were certain Bush Sr. had cracked and ordered a nuke strike. I forget how many hundreds of Iraqis died in the blast when the vacuum created by the MOAB actually sucked their lungs right up and out of their throats. I believe they called the bomb \"Bright Star\" back then.\r\n", "author_flair_css_class": null}
