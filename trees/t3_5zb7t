It violates known usability and industry best-practice guidelines constantly, the code and construction are at least seven years out of date, and it appears to have been put together by someone whose sole qualification is that they can use Dreamweaver.\n\nThis website should be an embarrassment to any serious institution, and will actively turn off anyone with even a passing knowledge of web design.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5zb7t", "retrieved_on": 1427425097, "body": "* Menu titles are images, instead of styles text - bad search-engine optimisation, bad usability... just generally bad.\n\n* Formatting uses huge nested tables and formatting HTML - you should have been using DIVs and CSS for several years now.\n\n* Comments like \"&lt;!-- END MAIN BODY --&gt;  \n&lt;!-- FOOTER STARTS HERE --&gt;  \n&lt;!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS SECTION --&gt;\" in the HTML code visible to the user lack professionalism.\n\n* No visual differentiation between menu items that are a single destination (eg. Undergraduate Programs) and menu items that are actually sub-menus (eg. Graduate Programs).\n\n* When you mouse-out of any link that pops up a sub-menu, the sub-menu doesn't disappear.  Try adding a Javascript event to each menu items to close all other open menus, or re-work your menu/mouse interaction code.\n\n* Don't use Dreamworks (or any tool) to write your code for you if you don't know enough to then go in and tidy it up later - the \"MM_\" prefix on the javascript function names are a dead giveaway.\n\n* Better still, don't use Dreamweaver *at all* unless you already know enough to get by without it.  Dreamweaver is like a big gun, pointed straight at your foot - it's a handy tool if you know enough to point it in the correct direction only in the right situation.  Otherwise say goodbye to your toes.\n\nThis is just a two-minute skim of the entrance page, and one quick look over the source code.
