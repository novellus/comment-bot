Yet this seems to be the crazy little guy from Ohio's best and first tactic.  I give the guy his points for balls, and I am 100% sure he is the real thing, not even a little bit \"evil\" (he's practically a superhero unfortunately one with no powers), but he's about as electable as Ross Perot and Ron Paul holding hands at a Church social.  If that changes and the heavens part and he gets the nomination of the Dems, I would absolutely vote for him before ANYBODY on the other side but RP.  But as it stands, he'll be lucky to get an audience during Hillary's first year as Madame President presiding over the Iraq/Iran war's 6th year (one letter, whatever).\n\nIf he talked about fiscal responsibility (and meant it) maybe we'd have a race.. but alot of things can change in, what, 12 months before the nomination?  Damn...  Well, in about 3-6 months St. Gore will announce and the rest will forfeit I guess, then he'll have support HIS continuance in Iraq by their lack of respect for the environment... but I digress.\n\nReally, once you are recognizable as the Hobbit you are really not electable are you?
