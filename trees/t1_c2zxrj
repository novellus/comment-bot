We have to recognize there are concepts underlying the word that we can talk about distinctly.  That is what I'm doing with evolution.

Whether Darwin thought his mechanisms were the only proper mechanisms for speciation is a moot point.  The fact that there are a number of other mechanisms than those Darwin originally proposed shows mine is a legitimate path to take.
