It is the passivity of the author.  He stands apart and witnesses what is happening but is not acting to change it.  Here's the deal with Mexicans in the United States.\n\nThey are poor.  They came to the US because they are poor.  They have big families here in order to survive (so everyone can work.)  Also because they have had limited education, limited healthcare, limited care at all, and are catholic, contraceptives are expensive and not used.  Many have dropped out of middle school.  Many cannot read or speak English.  They left Mexico because the jobs that they could receive would pay them anywhere from 5 to 10 dollars a day and they'd be work 70 hours a week.  In the United States they can make 20x more money, work 20x less, and own 20x more things.  This would make anyone, pretty excited.\n\nHowever they have to fit in.  They do not like not fitting in.  Mexicans want to fit in and it isn't that they are 'confining' themselves to their groups, its that they don't speak English!  The biggest barrier of all!  \n\nHowever, IF the author ever made an attempt to approach, or to converse with 'the Mexicans' he might find that they can be very, very friendly.  And you'd be shocked, you actually don't have to speak Spanish to do so!  Body language, basic words, gestures, can communicate friendliness more than anything.  What about when a Mexican family moves in to your small town, WELCOMING them??  Do you think that would make a difference, if all the neighbors come and bring something just to say hello!!  Yes!  They'd become a part of the community and all of a sudden you'd find yourself with good friends.\n\nAs Mexicans are, on a whole, much friendlier than Americans!  And all of a sudden all when you get to KNOW THEM their noise and kids arent so intimidating, the loud banda music, because you understand that it isn't them TRYING to bother you; it's that they come from a culture that TOLERATES everyone.\n\nIn Mexico you can make a lot of noise.  You can put firecrackers in the street and scream and the cops will not take you to jail.  You can go to a girl's balcony with a mariachi band.  You can get drunk in the streets and walk around.  You can make a U-Turn anywhere and you can back up on the highway and cause a huge traffic jam.  You can do whatever you want (for the most part.)\n\nPersonally having lived in Mexico for over a year, I like this.  This is why I live here.  I am not surprised at all by people's reactions (such as the authors) in the United States.  When Mexicans come to live in big groups, move into a town and do not fit in, are socially inept because of language barriers conflicts will arise.\n\nI suggest the author be pro-active.  Hate to be the bearer of bad news but maybe you could try learning Spanish.  Speaking Spanish will open up a huge window into the Mexican culture.\n\n2.  Have problems with Mexican kids?  Create an activity that engages them.  A soccer league!  Easier said than done, right?  Well, at least you can try.\n\n3.  Expose your children to Mexican culture.  Make them realize of course NOT ALL MEXICANS ARE RAPING AND SPRAY PAINTING YOUR TOWN but just a select few.\n\n4.  Stop yourself and realize in your little town of 900 that one group of 'bad Mexicans' does not make them all bad.\n\n5.  For the countless stories like your own, there are countless more where (for example) in my neighborhood Mexicans are respected (albeit separate) for their work ethic.  And naturally they do have a work ethic but Mexicans work...\n\nFifty to Sixty hours a week!  Minimum.\n\nAnyway more than anything I recommend going down to Mexico (not Cancun) and seeing how you feel then.\n\nC ", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "parent_id": "t3_5yioz", "id": "c029r5f", "author_flair_css_class": null}
