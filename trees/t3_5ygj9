My original issue was with how the article was written, not whether or not PCBEs are good or bad.

Rather than ban them maybe it would be better to bake things that have a lot of BCBEs. Say 24 hours at 120 degrees? Any way, the point isn't the exact treatment, but maybe there is something that can make them safer. Again, not addressed by the article.\n\nright. because the article was written to share the findings of a specific study that didn't address that. perhaps that study is in progress, or perhaps it was done 10 years ago. but there is no reason to expect it to be in that article. this author is not you. they might not have asked every question they should have, but this is starkly different from \"using scare tactics\". another example from your analysis:\n\n&gt;&gt;\"A National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences study found that PBDE levels in infants  and children were two- to threefold higher than in adults.\"\n\n&gt;Is this a dangerous level? Is it in parts per million? Parts per billion? Is it worse than, say, what one would get through natural exposure? Has it ever been shown to cause problem in peple?\n\nin the first paragraph of the article we learn, \"Americans' bodies have the world's highest concentration of the flame retardant polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) -- 10 to 40 times higher than Europeans -- and our chemical burden is doubling every three to five years.\"\n\nso in answer to your question, it's higher than the concentrations in the bodies of europeans whose governments have phased out the chemicals. so although there is not a number stated, it can be assumed that this is higher than a \"natural exposure\" (whatever you mean by that) would be. it even goes on to say, \"It used to be assumed that most PBDE contamination came through eating dairy, meat and fish. Increasingly, researchers are looking at indoor air where concentrations are 15 to 50 times higher than outside. In addition to sources such as dust from polyurethane foam and fabric, PBDEs can emit gas at 84 degrees -- a temperature common inside computers, cars and houses. The gas then clings to dust particles we breathe.\"\n\nthat's what the cat study and the niehs study both were trying to prove by demonstrating the higher concentrations of the chemical in cats and children. they are trying to determine where we're getting the chemical from. it's been known for years that we're accumulating it in our systems, which is why they can relate the rate of increase:\n\n&gt;[The second EHP study, by researchers at several California universities and health agencies including the California Environmental Protection Agency, found similar results when it measured the concentration of PBDEs in blood and fat tissue samples taken from women living in the San Francisco Bay Area of California. Levels in these samples were 5\u00d010 times higher than those reported in the European study. The authors of this study also compared measurements of levels in the current samples to samples taken from women in the area in the 1960s. The earlier samples contained no measurable levels of PBDEs.](http://www.ehponline.org/press/031003.html)\n\nwhat i got out of this article is that the epa is not being very vigilant with these chemicals by relying on industry data. the industry data is not comparable to the studies done here and abroad showing evidence of toxicity. [here's a less alarmist, but also less specific article saying much the same thing.](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/311845_pbdes17.html)\n\ni hope that helps. i did not understand this article to be saying \"ban this immediately!\"... i thought it was trying to call attention to the inadequate epa. if no one drives the industry to come up with a better flame retardant by demonstrating how toxic the current one is, there will never be an alternative.", "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02c8ex", "ups": 1, "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "politics", "ups": 1, "name": "t1_c02c8ex", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5ygj9", "retrieved_on": 1427424951, "score_hidden": false, "body": "&gt;    &gt;No, I have a lot of thing to deal with in my life.

This article fails to do that.\n\n&gt;what claim are you suspicious of? let's start there. \n\nGo back and read what I've written. Have I been unclear somehow? Is this just some sort of trolling to see if you can get a reaction? You might use a poorly written article as a springboard to find out more. If so, then good for you. I just see it as the writer falling down on the job.\n\n&gt;i would like to understand why you see scare tactics here and i don't. what do you find unreasonable? that the article advocates banning them? that's an opinion the author holds... it doesn't have to be proven. what claims do you quibble with?\n\nHonestly, this discussion is getting tireing... Its like a scab that I can't stop picking at... \n\nThe author says that PCBEs are bad, bad, bad and are in \"everything\". It even has the signature in breathless scare tactics: \"Won't someone think of the children!\". It says that the European way is the way to go, but doesn't provide anything real to back it up.\n\nThere very well may be a real problem with \"American\" usage of PCBEs. You wouldn't know it from reading the article. Some examples:\n\n    &gt; \"A National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences study found that PBDE levels in infants \n    &gt; and children were two- to threefold higher than in adults.\"\n\nIs this a dangerous level? Is it in parts per million? Parts per billion? Is it worse than, say, what one would get through natural exposure? Has it ever been shown to cause problem in peple? \n\nElsewhere it says\n\n&gt; \"Some [Americans] have concentrations [of deca] not dissimilar to amounts in animals that cause cancer of the thyroid and liver,\" says Birnbaum.\"\n\nHow many Americans is some? One? One million? Is it a class of people, like hazmat fire fighters? Children? How \"not dissimilar\" is the amount? What animals?\n\nAlso from the article:\n\n&gt; \"In addition to sources such as dust from polyurethane foam and fabric, PBDEs can emit gas at 84 degrees -- a temperature common inside computers, cars and houses. The gas then clings to dust particles we breathe.\"\n\nThis doesn't mean PCBEs should be banned. Rather than ban them maybe it would be better to *bake* things that have a lot of BCBEs. Say 24 hours at 120 degrees? Any way, the point isn't the exact treatment, but maybe there is something that can make them safer. Again, not addressed by the article.\n\n&gt; \"The EPA, while calling for more research, relies on industry testing and resists calls to ban or label PBDEs, arguing that until there are safer alternatives, their usefulness in retarding burning outweighs the risk.\"\n\nWhile I'm not big on relying on industry testing (after how well that worked with asbestos and cigaretts), I agree that the alternative must be safer. People do burn to death. I remember one time where my brother accidentally backed up to a lit candle during Christmas and his jacket started to catch on fire. He could have easily been horribly burned and perhaps killed. Fortunately, nothing happened except his new jacket was ruined. \n\nAbandoning something that works for something that doesn't work as well has a cost, in terms of human lives and suffering, as well as cost in dollars.
