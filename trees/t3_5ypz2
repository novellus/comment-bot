How is this fair, or even legal.  \n\nI don't have a problem with paying more to use more bandwidth, that is how most services go when you buy a shell or hosted server.  I buy 1terabyte of data transfer at a cost, and if I go over that, then I pay for it.  So Comcast either needs to STOP limiting unlimited internet, or give people clear definitions to what puts you over the limit.\n\nNo shell or webhost that offers GOOD service offers unlimited bandwidth usage, or they would be out of business.  IF you ever come across a webhost offering unlimited transfer, you can always assume that the offer is fraudulent, by one means or another.  many web hosting providers who say \"unlimited web traffic\" really means unlimited transfer but at whatever speed we limit you too, which therefore is very limiting, but for the guy hosting a crappy small site, he doesn't care. \nIt's all in the fine print these days.\n\nI think this has less to do with bandwidth consumption though and more to do with the beginnings of traffic shaping for corporate agendas.\n\n ", "author": "amsterdamordeth", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "gilded": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_5ypz2", "id": "c02a833", "author_flair_css_class": null}

BitTorrent users who are heavy users of bandwidth would pay more, while average home users would pay less.\n\nA prerequisite for this would be for Comcast to come clean with what they are actually doing on the network.  They already have tiered service in the form of home and workplace accounts, but I'll be damned if I'm going to make an expensive upgrade without any believable reassurances that they wont pull the same BS on the upper tier service.\n\nCurrently Comcast is actively lying about the filtering they are doing, so how can I trust them?", "author": "Tinidril", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c02b3lr", "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c02b3lr", "parent_id": "t3_5ypz2", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}
