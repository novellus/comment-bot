It's mediated public vengeance.  Your question reveals this clearly, you need not kill someone to prevent them from repeating their crime, but a great many people *want* to kill those guilty of murder.  This does have some basis in psychology, but I would prefer that we admit that it's revenge rather than pretend it's somehow noble.\n\nI'm not against capital punishment, but it must be greatly weighted in favor of the innocent.
