While an authoritative dictionary may have 40K characters and an everyday dictionary has 10K characters, a middle school dictionary can probably get by with about 3000 characters.  While learning Chinese, elementary school children keep track of their progress by counting the number of characters that they know.  2000 characters is probably truly enough to read a tabloid newspaper, menus, signs, and everyday words.\n\nThe PRC government defines basic literacy as 2000 characters (probably around middle school level).  Most well educated Chinese know between 5000 to 7000 characters - enough to delve into political or technical language.  The characters over 10K are typically archaic or classic Chinese - words that are rarely if ever used, though you may want to know them if you study classical literature.\n\nMr Moser's problem is that he did not grow up speaking Chinese to his parents or listening to people speak Chinese.  Therefore, when he sees a new character in a newspaper, he doesn't have the context to put it together.  The Chinese education system is very different from the English one.  From a young age, children recite memorized poems (especially Tang dynasty poems).  This encodes their phrase recognition skills so that when they encounter new characters, they can make a good guess at their context and therefore their meaning.\n\nMr Moser is correct that a foreigner armed with 2000 characters is hopeless, but a Chinese child can read basic texts with 2000 characters.  His troubles are no different than an American going to England, and having someone talk Cockney at him.

There are a lot of popular books and articles that downplay this difficulty, saying things like 'Despite the fact that Chinese has [10,000, 25,000, 50,000, take your pick] separate characters you really only need 2,000 or so to read a newspaper'. Poppycock. I couldn't comfortably read a newspaper when I had 2,000 characters under my belt. I often had to look up several characters per line, and even after that I had trouble pulling the meaning out of the article. (I take it as a given that what is meant by 'read' in this context is 'read and basically comprehend the text without having to look up dozens of characters'; otherwise the claim is rather empty.)\r\n\r\n\"This fairy tale is promulgated because of the fact that, when you look at the character frequencies, over 95% of the characters in any newspaper are easily among the first 2,000 most common ones. But what such accounts don't tell you is that there will still be plenty of unfamiliar words made up of those familiar characters. (To illustrate this problem, note that in English, knowing the words 'up' and 'tight' doesn't mean you know the word 'uptight'.) Plus, as anyone who has studied any language knows, you can often be familiar with every single word in a text and still not be able to grasp the meaning. Reading comprehension is not simply a matter of knowing a lot of words; one has to get a feeling for how those words combine with other words in a multitude of different contexts. In addition, there is the obvious fact that even though you may know 95% of the characters in a given text, the remaining 5% are often the very characters that are crucial for understanding the main point of the text.

It was like learning Chinese characters but even worse;  at least Chinese characters *sometimes* have meaningful radicals.\n\nNow when I learn a new Chinese word, at least I can frequently remember the word based on the meanings of its parts.

To briefly summarize, he heard a French word he didn't know (shock absorber), but later encountered that word, in writing, in a context where its meaning was obvious (a shop selling shock absorbers).  Because he could read the word in context and could associate that written word with the sounds of the previously-heard unknown word, he expanded his conversational vocabulary.\n\nThis is much harder to do with an ideographic writing system where the sounds of words cannot quickly and easily be derived from their ideograms (and vice versa).  So in the previous example he would probably have not been able to associate the newly-known written word with the unknown spoken word and would still be unable to use it in conversation despite having \"both peices of the puzzle.\"\n\nSure English spelling rules and 'alphabetical order' are arbitrary, but it doesn't take much education in them to become proficient enough to read decently, write in a manner comprehensible to at least native speakers or look up unknown words/spellings in dictionaries.

Likely you've been watching too many gungfu movies.\n\nWhile an extremely difficult writing system to learn, hanzi are far more precise and meaningful than any phonetic alphabet can manage. As for the -many- Chinese language(s) as a whole... hanzi are not so important for learning them. This is why many East Asian nations that previously used Chinese writing developed alternate phonetic systems (Korea, Japan, Vietnam...). However, if one is learning Chinese, then you can appreciate the beauty and elegence of Chinese characters.\n\nAn interesting point is raised by the idea of English having a similar writing system to hanzi. The usefulness of Chinese characters throughout history was in their ability to transmit meaning across linguistic barriers, to unite the disparate linguistics groups that made up China's empire and tributary states. In the globalized world of today, it might be useful for a unified system of meaning, that while not violating the love that everyone has for their native languages, allows for a codec that everyone can speak in together. Particularly, the pre-reform grammer of ancient Chinese conveys a great deal of meaning very succinctly and was used for hundreds ofyears by people from as far north as Hokkaido and as far South as Vietnam.
