However, I sense your civility is stretching thin by the challenge of communicating to and about the militant left.  Their language, verb and noun choices, twisted syntax and reliance in \"name calling\" is starting to creep in your posts.  \n\nUndoubtedly, you are a committed \"man of words\" and possess high intelligence.  My sincerest hope is that you realize their goal is to debase and contaminate you while they enter the slow, downward spiral into oblivion (spiting on you, as it were, from hell) .\n\nIf they succeed, and you spit back, you may justify them and their arguments for a time adding more to their number and reducing the numbers on ours.  \n\nDon't lose your clarity, logic, sense of fair play, dignity and intelligent voice.  These will always win in the end.   Because it does not matter if you win or lose a battle, they have already lost the war and I think they are beginning to realize it. \n\nI look forward to visiting your site.\n\nA faithful reader.", "author": "BrianAndKalliDavis", "created_utc": "1193105680", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5yw5r", "id": "c02ap3a", "author_flair_css_class": null}
