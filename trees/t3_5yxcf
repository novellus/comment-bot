I was struck by the contradiction of trying to reduce environmental impact whilst also maintaing a healthy economy. The capatalist system that we live by is all about creating, selling and profit being the bottom line so we may consume more. How can we ever think that our endeavours to save the planet will be successful with the underlying principle of society being GAIN as oppose to human, environmental, planetary and natural welfare.", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "name": "t1_c02as68", "parent_id": "t3_5yxcf", "ups": 1, "author_flair_css_class": null}
