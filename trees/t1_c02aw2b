Please read the notes below. Some more information is available at the F# Wiki.\r\n\r\n* Mono version 1.1.18 or later is required.\r\n* Install the F# libraries to the GAC using install-mono.sh. This script also contains the commands to trigger pre-compilation, though some versions of Mono have had problems with pre-compilation so this is not applied by default. This script also renames fscp10.exe to be fsc.exe, and likewise fsi10.exe becomes fsi.exe for reasons explained below.\r\n* Run the compiler using mono bin/fsc.exe. You will want to make an alias for this. (As mentioned above this is really the file bin/fscp10.exe in the original distribution. This is a .NET 1.0 portable version of the F# command-line compiler which does not use .NET generics in its implementation and which runs on all CLI implementations.)\r\n* Run F# Interactive compiler using mono bin/fsi.exe. You may wish to make an alias for this. (As mentioned above this is really the file bin/fscp10.exe in the original distribution. This is a .NET 1.0 portable version of the F# Interactive which does not use .NET generics in its implementation and which runs on all CLI implementations.)\r\n* The use of pre-compilation (mono --aot) is strongly recommended to improve startup times for mono bin/fsc.exe. Run this on fslib10.dll, mllib10.dll, FSharp.Compiler10.dll and fscp10.exe. As of Mono 1.1.18 this halves compiler startup time. Some issues have been reported on Mono/MacOS.\r\n* Debugging symbols are not generated. Using the -g flag will generate a warning.\r\n* Strong name signing is not supported directly by the F# compiler. Use the sn.exe tool.\r\n* As of Mono version 1.1.18 only the .NET 1.x Mono profile may currently be used with fsi.exe. This means some generic constructs are not available when using fsi.exe under Mono, and some samples do not work correctly.\r\n* F# has in the past exposed Mono bugs in corner cases. If you see a problem, this is likely to be the result of a bug in Mono. Please be sure to investigate and report these to both the F# team and through the Mono bug reporting process. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact that you have to build your own aliases to run these things decently means that it's not completely batteries included, and the lack of debugging symbols is certainly annoying. But I was pretty happy working with the F#/Mono setup I had once I got it working decently in Emacs.
