That said; England defended strongly enough that France didn't get the chance to break through, despite being given lots of possession.\n\nAs one of the commentators said during the game, semi-finals are just about winning.  There's no other consideration.\n\n**Note for readers unfamiliar with rugby:** it's a fast and constantly-moving game in which a player who is tackled is immediately stepped over by his team-mates ('rucking'), allowing the ball to be picked up and possession retained.  From what I remember of school rugby, playing in the forward line is an exhausting round of crashing into rucks, picking yourself up and getting into the next one.\n\nThere are also mauls, where the tackled player stays on his feet and a big pushing match occurs.  The thing is, these and the common stoppage plays (scrums and lineouts) are all *generally* won by the side who has possession, but not *exclusively* so.  So defence lies in being organised, getting into place so the opponents can't break through, and forcing turnovers where you can.\n\nEngland did this well enough that they avoided losing the game, despite giving up a lot of possession with bad kicking.  (Kicking up the field gains lots of territory, but for it to be a win, you need to kick the ball to a position where it's difficult for the opposing back line to quickly catch and return it).\n\nThe above explanation won't satisfy a rugby purist, but may help to describe the game to Americans.
