Having recently visited Monticello, (Jefferson's digs), a few tidbits are still in memory banks which may be interesting to share for those fanboys wishing to compare their idol with Jefferson. \r\n\r\n1. Jefferson kept slaves and, rather infamously, had children by at least one of them.\r\n\r\n2. Jefferson was a staunch believer in the separation of Church and State. (Ron Paul, as we know wants those lines blurred and has written that the church supercedes the state.)\r\n\r\n3. Jefferson co-founded the Democratic-Republican Party which would later become the modern Democratic Party.\r\n\r\n4. Jefferson was amazingly well read, and was a reknowned horticulturist, statesman, architect, archaeologist, paleontologist, author, inventor and founder of the University of Virginia. (Ron Paul is what? A goldbug?)\r\n\r\n5. Jefferson once wrote that he hoped *monied corporations would be crushed* as he felt they threatened gov't. (He usually sided with subsistence farmers.)
