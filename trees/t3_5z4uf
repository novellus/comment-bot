Standing up for that can hardly be characterized as being leftist, when it's the majority opinion.\n\n\"Babies born after a botched abortion\", that sounds like demagoguery, not serious legislative language. Come on.\n\nMany centrist Democrats opposed the nominations of Roberts and Alito.\n\nAnd as for your \"pro-UN and global government group\" (which I've never heard of, and the description is clearly supposed to be some sort of shibboleth for the right): according to that scorecard, all of those Democrats, liberal, moderate, or conservative, got an A+.
