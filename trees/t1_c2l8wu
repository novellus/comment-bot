Nature has neither, hence it cannot care one way or the other.\r\n\r\nOur being and our non-being mean nothing to \"nature.\" The universe can't even _care_. It's an impossibility. That's like debating whether or not asphalt can care about its potholes or atoms can care about losing an electron. What's to care about?
