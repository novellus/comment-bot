In order to achieve their goal of creating an ethnically \"pure\" Tamil state in the North and East of Sri Lanka, the LTTE forcibly expelled the entire Muslim community - numbered at around 80,000 - from the northern Jaffna peninsular of the island. They were forced to leave within 48 hours of an LTTE warning and not permitted to take any of their belongings, which were subsequently looted by the LTTE. \r\n\r\n&gt;The widespread ethnic cleansing accompanying the Yugoslav wars from 1991 to 1999, of which the most significant examples occurred in eastern Croatia and self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina (1991-1995), in most of Bosnia (1992-1995), and in the Albanian-dominated breakaway Kosovo province (of Serbia) (1999). Large numbers of Serbs, Croats, Bosniaks and Albanians were forced to flee their homes and expelled.[74] \r\n\r\n&gt;The forced displacement and ethnic-cleansing of more than 250,000 people, mostly Georgians but some others too, from Abkhazia during the conflict and after in 1993 and 1998.[75] \r\n\r\n&gt;**The 1994 massacres of nearly one million Tutsis by Hutus, known as the Rwandan Genocide[76][better citation needed]**\r\n\r\n&gt;The mass expulsion of southern Lhotshampas (Bhutanese of Nepalese origin) by the northern Druk majority of Bhutan in 1990.[77] The number of refugees is approximately 103,000.[78] \r\n\r\n&gt;Displacement of more than 500,000 Chechen and ethnic Russian civilians living in Chechnya during the First Chechen War in 1994-1996.[79][80][81] \r\n\r\n&gt;More than 800,000 Kosovo Albanians fled their homes in Kosovo during the Kosovo War in 1999. By November 1999, most of the Albanians had returned to Kosovo. Over 200,000 Serbs and other non-Albanian minorities fled or were expelled from Kosovo after the war.[82][83] \r\n\r\n&gt;**Expulsion of white farmers by the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe in 2000. There were 270,000 whites in Zimbabwe (when the country was known as Rhodesia) in 1970. There are only a few thousand whites left in Zimbabwe today.**\r\n\r\n&gt;**Attacks by the Janjaweed Arabs, Muslim militias of Sudan on the African population of Darfur, a region of western Sudan.[84][85] A July 14, 2007 article notes that in the past two months up to 75,000 Arabs from Chad and Niger crossed the border into Darfur. Most have been relocated by the Sudanese government to former villages of displaced non-Arab people. Some 2.5 million have now been forced to flee their homes after attacks by Sudanese troops and Janjaweed militia.[86]**\r\n\r\n&gt;Currently in the Iraq Civil War (2003 to present), entire neighborhoods in Baghdad are being ethnically cleansed by Shia and Sunni Militias. Some areas are being evacuated by every member of a particular secular group due to lack of security, moving into new areas because of fear of reprisal killings. As of June 21, 2007, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimated that 2.2 million Iraqis had been displaced to neighboring countries, and 2 million were displaced internally, with nearly 100,000 Iraqis fleeing to Syria and Jordan each month.[87][88] \r\n\r\n&gt;Although Iraqi Christians represent less than 5% of the total Iraqi population, they make up 40% of the refugees now living in nearby countries, according to UNHCR.[89][90] In the 16th century, Christians constituted half of Iraq's population.[91] In 1987, the last Iraqi census counted 1.4 million Christians.[92] But as the 2003 invasion has radicalized Islamic sensibilities, Christians' total numbers slumped to about 500,000, of whom 250,000 live in Baghdad.[93] Furthermore, the Mandaean and Yazidi communities are at the risk of elimination due to the ongoing atrocities by Islamic extremists.[94][95] A May 25, 2007 article notes that in the past 7 months only 69 people from Iraq have been granted refugee status in the United States.[96] \r\n\r\n&gt;The ethnic cleansing of African American population of some racially mixed Los Angeles neighborhoods by Mexican street gangs. According to gang experts and law enforcement agents the Mexican Mafia leaders, or shot callers, have issued a \"green light\" on all blacks.[97][98][99][100][101] \r\n\r\n&gt;**In October 2006, Niger announced that it would deport the Arabs living in the Diffa region of eastern Niger to Chad.[102] This population numbered about 150,000.[103] While the government was rounding Arabs in preparation for the deportation, two girls died, reportedly after fleeing government forces, and three women suffered miscarriages. Niger's government had eventually suspended a controversial decision to deport Arabs.[104][105]**\r\n", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "science", "name": "t1_c029oau", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 3, "link_id": "t3_5yhy3", "retrieved_on": 1427426215, "body": "No, actually I dont.\n\nYou make a claim about how the reason you dont hear about other cultures ethnically and racially persecuting eachother is because it depends on where i listen, so i am asking you if there are reports of ethnic cleansing elsewhere going on right now, or is just in that region of the world?\n\nThe proper response is: \"No, i was pretty much talking out my ass because that is the only part of the world that has had repeated ethnic cleansings over the last 2 decades.\"\n\nIm sorry it was a difficult question for you.\n\nWant a peanut?", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c029o9v", "id": "c029oau", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "science", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 3, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5yhy3", "retrieved_on": 1427426215, "body": "I don't follow... non-sequiter, much?", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c029o9v", "parent_id": "t1_c029o55", "id": "c029o9v", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "science", "ups": 0, "name": "t1_c029o55", "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5yhy3", "retrieved_on": 1427426217, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c029o55", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c029nyx", "body": "So there are reports of ethnic cleansing in mexico last month?  or in canada?", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "science", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 10, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5yhy3", "retrieved_on": 1427426219, "id": "c029nyx", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "name": "t1_c029nyx", "parent_id": "t1_c029nx8", "body": "what you hear about a particular subject depends entirely on what you listen to...

Intelligence is a social/psychological construction. The 'evolution' of social and psychological constructions - such as ways of thinking (related to intelligence) and the content of thoughts (e.g. morality is one example) is so much faster than genetic evolution, that genetics might be far less relevant.

I think the *entire* debate on IQ and race revolves around what portion of intelligence gap is heritable and what portion is environmental.  Some say it is predominantly a social phenomena, some say it is predominantly a genetic phenomena.  Unfortunately, this issue is one where the modern system of peer review fails us because scientific scrutiny often gives way to social outcry.\n\nMy superior (I work at a research lab) was recently discussing a pending article in Nature which examined the correlation between  genetics and intelligence.  The genetic features were grouped into Mongoloid, Caucasoid, and Negroid (which are actually pretty distinct genetically).\n\nI didn't read the paper myself, but my boss told me the gist of it was a distinct correlation between certain genetic factors and intelligence.  To which he said \"they can't publish this.\"  I said \"why not?\"  He replied \"you just can't say that, it would be a disaster.\"\n\nIt really made me start to think about this brave new post-genome world we're living in.  We expect to uncover so much about ourselves, but somehow we want it all to be happy.  How can we hope to find cures for disease, but not find a few skeletons in our closet?\n\nWe believe all men are created equal, but only a fool would think all men are created the same.\n\nIf academics are uncomfortable with the idea of different races having a genetic predisposition to different levels of intelligence, maybe its because they have felt comfortable judging people based on their intelligence for hundreds of years. Now their intolerance of those less clever may, in fact, be just as bad as a father forbidding his daughter to date black men.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. was right when said \"judge me . . . by the content of my character.\"", "author_flair_css_class": "eng"}, {"controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "science", "author_flair_text": null, "name": "t1_c029qau", "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5yhy3", "retrieved_on": 1427426189, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c029qau", "author": "awkward", "created_utc": "1192650191", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_c029pab", "body": "I think you have to admit that most people wouldn't call a culture who wore plate mail in the middle of Africa smart.", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 8, "author": "conundri", "created_utc": "1192651736", "children": [{"controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "science", "archived": true, "ups": 1, "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5yhy3", "retrieved_on": 1427426169, "score": 1, "body": "Actually, almost all of it depends on natural resources, including the varieties of domesticable animals and plants, as well as the types of diseases native to a certain environment... and even the weather.", "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": "1192663521", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c029rtr", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "name": "t1_c029rtr", "parent_id": "t1_c029qic", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "science", "ups": 8, "name": "t1_c029qic", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5yhy3", "retrieved_on": 1427426186, "score_hidden": false, "body": "Some of that depends on the natural resources available in the place where you live.

I AM SAYING that there were suppressed traits that could have had, over generations (after importation of genetic lines), an impact on sexual selection as well as a *potential* for an artificial environmental and social structure heirarchy created and affected by the slave trade itself.\r\n\r\nDid that make sense?\r\n\r\nAmplify that 15% loss of each ship over a period of years and slaves.  300 or so years.  As stated before, it's easy to stretch the imagination to realize that those 15% were probably very similar deaths for similar reasons which would likely cause similar genetic suppression of the population.\r\n\r\nNow, stir in reproduction of imported slaves in the americas based on the 'new' paradigm of sexual and social selection under the slave system:  what would give a slave family the best odds at having the best life?  intelligence? No. Strength? Yup.  No slave owner wanted an intelligent slave.  Intelligent slaves are far more dangerous than docile yet strong ones.\r\n\r\nEugenics (like the holocaust) wasn't even a word in the slave trade times.  There are myriad factors that played a role in creating the gene pool in the americas at that time, but I think it's really a stretch to think that it had a negligible impact on the genetic diversity of blacks in america.\r\n\r\nMy point about 'mixed' blacks was in and of itself a two dimensional comment.  I appreciate you calling me out on that.  In the case of the 'cultural' black (american indian, white, black mix), the endemic social conditions and political (lack) will are the largest suppressive factors.\r\n\r\nAs somebody said earlier in another comment, race is hard to define.

I'm sure it favoured slaves who were healthier and more importantly who *appeared* healthier and stronger.\n\nIt is possible that such selection bias would have some kind of effect on those who are defendants of slaves, although with the exception of \"those with gene X wouldn't have survived the trip\" type traits, it isn't that likely that you'd see much of a statistically significant impact. Furthermore, there is a big difference between talking about \"decedents of slaves\" and \"blacks\".\n\nI seriously doubt that anyone was testing their potential slave's intelligence in anything resembling an accurate fashion.

Even if that were true, there's the whole \"correlation does not equal causation\" elephant in the room. Heck, it seems entirely plausible that you've got it backwards (poverty may lead to societies which are more divided along racial lines, particularly in terms of selecting a mate).\n\n&gt; This is also true of whites in the deep south (ozarks) who have selectively bred (family trees without branches.. anyone?) and are simply (yes, this is anecdotal.. shut up) not as intelligent as a more diverse cross section of the population.\n\nDude.. that's not even about selective breeding, that's about inbreeding depression.

From the wiki on IQ (emphasis mine):\n\n&gt;There are some family effects on the IQ of children, accounting for up to a quarter of the variance. However, by adulthood, **this correlation disappears, such that adoptive siblings are not more similar in IQ than strangers**. For IQ, adoption studies show that, after adolescence, adoptive siblings are no more similar in IQ than strangers (IQ correlation near zero), while full siblings show an IQ correlation of 0.6. Twin studies reinforce this pattern: monozygotic (identical) twins raised separately are highly similar in IQ (0.86), more so than dizygotic (fraternal) twins raised together (0.6) and much more than adoptive siblings (~0.0).[12] The American Psychological Association's report Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns (1995)[10] states that there is no doubt that normal child development requires a certain minimum level of responsible care. Severely deprived, neglectful, or abusive environments must have negative effects on a great many aspects of development, including intellectual aspects. **Beyond that minimum, however, the role of family experience is in serious dispute.**\n\nIn other words, you can adopt a child with low IQ, and even though you give it all the education and discipline in the world, in the end his IQ won't change.  There's **zero** correlation between adoptive siblings, and the closer two people get genetically, the higher the correlation between their IQ (i.e., identical twins are closer than fraternal twins), implying IQ is a function of your genes.

The terms \"black\", \"white\" or \"arab\" (why does everyone leave the arabs out of race discussions?) are useful in conversations, but they rarely come up in science anymore. You don't see articles about \"operating on the heart of a negro\" or \"the psychiatric profile of the white male\". You can say that this is for \"PC\" reasons or whatever, but most scientists tend to err on the side of facts. If black people really needed different medical care, doctors would have no problem publishing those facts in medical journals in an effort to save more lives. But they don't, because at the end of the day there aren't any differences important enough. Ask any doctor...all the races are the same on the inside. And yes, \"the inside\" extends all the way up to the brain.\n\nBut back to my original point, I haven't yet seen any evidence that science can tell my race based on my DNA. I have seen DNA used to link a person's ancestry to a specific region of the world (be it europe, africa, etc) which I will admit is a good indicator of race.

Which is why defining such groups makes sense.  Of course, any *particular* individual might not fall into exactly one group -- but that doesn't mean you can't mathematically characterize the groups themselves.\n\nI think it's terrible that people hold back science that studies this sort of thing purely based on their subject opinion that it's distasteful.

Well that too I believe can be explained by geography. The explanation has its basis in the ratio of coastline to liveable land-mass.\n\nEurope, of all the regions of the world, is blessed with the perfect geography for a civilisation of expansive exploration and constant warfare (one of the biggest spurring forces for technological, political and social development).\n\nEurope is ideal for agriculture, has a predominantly East-West geography for migration and travel (which includes the spread of germs), perhaps the best selection of domesticable native animals, and so does China and India. China and India both developed complex, highly ordered societies with advanced trade and philosophies, but stopped at that. Why? It's because of their coast-line to land-mass ratio, and because their geography favours longer periods of wide-spread peace and civil order.\n\nThe high degree of european coastline made naval power in Europe paramount. Whilst Rome never focused as heavily on naval power, because their civilisation was founded on land-conquest, and they tended to remain true to that model throughout once it was established. Although, Naval power did play an important role in the history of the Mediterranean. This was of course not forgotten. It comes as no surprise that it was the only large Island culture of Europe (England) which was to forge the most preeminent global empire. Whilst the indians and chinese did have a navy and trading ships, they never placed the same emphasis on sea-power that the europeans did. The Chinese were too busy building a bloody great big wall and their three attempts to invade Japan were fatal humiliations. India had little need for expansion or military might, and mountains protected their greater land mass and the sheiks were contend to enjoy their Caste privileges after beating back the Moslem invasion of the 13th century. In the meantime Europe was always full of numerous and vacillating conflicts, which spurred forth the development of gun-powder to levels the Chinese never had a need to develop it. \n\nThe emphasis on Naval power provided Europeans with a world Empire that made the cultivation of achievement flow hand in hand with knowledge gained from all over the world to add their own, and additional incentives in the way of a heightened atmosphere of competition; where India and China were happy to maintain trade routes for regular everyday luxuries, the prize of the naval-power-secured trade-routes and colonies of the Europeans added a competitive dimension to their fields of science, medicine, warfare, and technical prowness (as promoted and husbanded by the aspiration powers) necessary for pushing into regions of both geography and enterprise (eg, Suez and Panama Canal, circumnavigation of the globe etc) that were simply regarded as unnecessary risks by India and China whom never competed with anyone else in the Naval Power arena; resulting in largely peaceful, but uninteresting and unchanging, trade and trading routes.

The various sorts of intelligence seem pretty fine-grained to me.\n\nI guess I would only think that two things (nebulously defined) have no difference (before measuring) if I know that they were produced from the same process with no known differences in what went in or how the process proceeded.  Otherwise, I'd guess some differences exist.  Does all that seem invalid too?

All I have come up with is socialized and mandatory education that is \"free\"(free only because you do not pay for it up front but on the back end when you die and all that money goes back to the government, world, education system which helped make it possible via your education) but you would have a free education in any interest you had for the rest of your life.  This would fuel a true meritocracy.  I have also considered using money from those who have passed on to fund low income housing and basic amenities as well.  It would be a system a little akin to socialism but directed to the future and human advancement.  For instance everyone would get the bare minimum to subsist but if they want technology that has come out in say the last twenty years instead of their old \"government issued computer\" then they would have to work to earn it.  This in my opinion would make it safe to raise children financially for the propagation of our species as well as add incentive to work, invent and be creative.  We have passed the level of technology necessary to take care of everyones needs we are just more concentrated on 52 different colors of the same item.  If we fully automated factories and worked as a species towards making sure everyone had food, shelter, pc, electricity, education we could be successful in less than a hundred years, I would argue much less.  Then humanity would be free to build on our predecessors instead of being forced to continually reinvent them, rebuilding the same things over and over again only to tear them down or neglect them.  This would be a society of advancement and knowledge though instead of a society of \"he with the most toys wins.\"  I think it may be where we are in a few hundred years but not until then.  As far as indoctrination of ideology goes the best way to avoid this is through transparency and avoiding hypocrisy by being honest.  Some will always go a different way if allowed and bring back a new perspective I think the problem in the current world in which we live is that when you try to teach you must have moral authority.

Gould's brilliant, funny, engaging prose dissects the motivations behind those who would judge intelligence, and hence worth, by cranial size, convolutions, or score on extremely narrow tests. How did scientists decide that intelligence was unipolar and quantifiable, and why did the standard keep changing over time? Gould's answer is clear and simple: power maintains itself. European men of the 19th century, even before Darwin, saw themselves as the pinnacle of creation and sought to prove this assertion through hard measurement. When one measure was found to place members of some \"inferior\" group such as women or Southeast Asians over the supposedly rightful champions, it would be discarded and replaced with a new, more comfortable measure. The 20th-century obsession with numbers led to the institutionalization of IQ testing and subsequent assignment to work (and rewards) commensurate with the score, shown by Gould to be not simply misguided--for surely intelligence is multifactorial--but also regressive, creating a feedback loop rewarding the rich and powerful.

I assume that African blacks have higher IQ scores. And in fact, I think this is borne out by the statistics of how many black spots at the elite universities (and afterwards, investment banks, and so on) are taken by African blacks, rather than American blacks. I went to an Ivy league college, and almost all my black friends were from Africa (usually Nigeria).  \n\nThat's the thing about affirmative action. It's supposed to benefit the descendants of slaves, but actually helps African immigrants. The head of investment banking at CSFB is a Nigerian, for example.\n\nThe same theory about why American blacks may have lower IQ can also be applied to Jews. Why do Jews have higher IQ levels? Because most Jews were killed in various holocausts and pogroms throughout history.  Only the smartest, best-connected, or most useful survived.\n\nAs for Asians, again the IQ numbers we're seeing are of American Asians, and there is a selection bias.  The smartest ones get here, the dumber ones stay at home.\n\nYou might think this would apply to Mexicans, but the statistics don't seem to bear this out. This would seem to contravene the theory, suggesting there may be innate differences in IQ.\n\nBut IQ is not the only thing that matters, there is EQ and plain hard work that accounts for most success.  However, there are also reasons to believe that EQ is highly correlated with IQ.  Afterall, a smart person is more likely to appreciate the subtleties of social dynamics and can \"game\" the system of social relations.\n\nAt the end of the day, I think it's not critical that everyone in a country be smart, but it is critical that there is at least a core group of high-IQ people.  \n\nBut third-world development has as much to do with environmental conditions as it does with IQ.

I assume first off they only captured what looked like the most fit black people for fear a weak or sick one would most likely die on the boat. I also am going to assume that the more intelligent black people (or tribes) were smart enough to avoid capture altogether.\n\nAfter being captured only the strongest and fittest would survive the trip. Once in America, the more intelligent ones would try to escape or plot and kill their captors, resulting in their quick and untimely deaths. Of course there would always be a few that were smart enough to just play along.\n\nI am also going to assume that the slave owners tried to breed the biggest and strongest of the black people so they could produce similar offspring, no different than cattle I suppose. They probably didn't find any point in breeding black people that showed signs of intelligence, they were looking for workers not scholars. This resulted in a large group of predominately strong and athletic, but highly unintelligent offspring.\n\nSo today, excluding interracial breeding, we have a predominately large group of strong and athletic black men and woman with lower than average intelligence.\n\nFrom my own personal experience, this is pretty much spot on. Most of the black people I have met are easy going and nice, but can't hold down a job and do terrible in school. Every single one I have met though is a great athlete or at least good at sports.

Drew had discovered that by separating the plasma (the liquid part of blood) from the whole blood (in which the red blood cells exist) and then refrigerating them separately, they could be combined up to a week later for a blood transfusion. He also discovered that while everyone has a certain type of blood (A, B, AB, or O) and thus are prevented from receiving a full blood transfusion from someone with different blood, everyone has the same type of plasma. Thus, in certain cases where a whole blood transfusion is not necessary, it was sufficient to give a plasma transfusion which could be administered to anyone, regardless of their blood type.\n\nW.
