The FISA law contains no prohibitions against tapping calls between non-US citizens. None! They can tape them all without restriction. Furthermore, there is a provision that allows for up to 72 hours of surveillance of US citizens without a warrant, in emergencies. So the authorities do NOT need to get a warrant first. Repeat, FISA allows wiretapping without a warrant. They can get one retroactively three days later. Andrew McCarthy is a liar and the National Review lowers itself to the level of the National Enquirer and the World Weekly News that you get in the grocery story checkout line by publishing this. McCarthy says that \u201cFISA was a bad idea from the start.\u201d If he bothered to consult history he would learn that the FISA courts were set up because Republican president Richard Nixon used the excuse of national security to spy on American citizens who disagreed with him, his famous \u201cenemies list.\u201d There is now evidence coming to light that Pentagon and the Justice Department under Bush used the same excuse to spy on American citizens who protested against the Iraq War. This is the very thing that the FISA law was passed to prevent: an American President spying on US citizens using their constitutionally protected right of free speech and assembly to disagree with the government. Andrew McCarthy would have us descend into Andrew McCarthyism. Voted down for bullshit.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
