If you are depressed, get help. If your primary care provider just puts you on meds, go to talk therapy as well. Spending your 20's bummed and asocial will have long-lasting consequences.\n\nIn what way do you define depressed?  If you define depressed as literally crying yourself to sleep every night or slashing your wrists in the bathroom, then I'm not going to argue with you.  But on the other hand, if you are defining depressed at 20 as being bummed and asocial like the rest of that comment suggests, then I have to take issue with your advice to seek help with a therapist.\n\nI'm going to take in another quote from another post by frobischer, but I think your comment is a similar sentiment and I apologize if I'm incorrect.\n\n&gt; Actually number 8 hit pretty close to home for me. Looking back on the latter-half of my twenties I find I didn't socialize much, didn't date, and wasted about five years of my life.\n\nFor some people, this might be true.  However, to me, I've experienced, albiet to a lesser extent, what socialization and what a social life is like.  To me, the ever persisting pressures of developing social networks, maintaining likeability, and other responsibilities (not exactly responsibilities, but they act like them on your psyche), are worse than the asocial life that I currently lead.  The benefits of the socialness, the feeling of belonging, etc, do not in any way outweigh the negatives.  Call me a pussy, call me lazy, call me whatever I don't care.  I just don't like responsibility because I cannot handle stress.\n\nShould I be on medications for this?  Who knows, but the solution of drugs to fix my feelings 100% of the day is not the solution in my mind.  Solitude and slight bumming, if used correctly, is actually entirely blissful.  I know it sounds ridiculous and a contradiction of terms, but you can be sad and blissful at the same time.  I think it was explained very well in the movie \"The Science of Sleep\", in that some people are more comfortable in sadness.\n\nNo, I'm not an Emo.  No I don't wear black and cry and pretend to slit my wrists so people will care about me.  I generally keep this fact about my life to myself.  In fact, I work quite a bit I just prefer to stay away from high responsibility.  I'm currently in college, enrolled as a full time student, work 20 hours a week as a programmer, and also work on personal projects and/or hack in my spare time.\n\nSo what is considered \"wasting my time\"?  I know quite a few drug addicts, and watching them I don't even consider them as wasting their time more in relation to other people.\n\nAren't we all wasting our time?  What would you rather me do, even assuming I didn't go to school and didn't work on anything?  Would you rather me socialize?  It seems like you've painted people into a corner by defining the concept of \"a life\" as being social, like everyone else seems to do.  Isn't that just wasting time until you die as well, though?  Isn't programming wasting time?  Why is \"productivity\" in society suddenly not wasting time, when we all die anyway?\n\n&gt; All we do is create more and more ingenious ways of wasting time.  I'm sick of it!\n&gt; *- Dave Lister*\n\nThe main problem I have with \"self help\" books, \"self help\" blog posts, or \"self help\" anything for that matter is that you generalize your life and your solutions to life and assume they are 100% universal.  It's stereotyping yourself, essentially, and it destroys the concept of individualism.  In fact, it's not even \"self\" help by definition, since a person is helping you.\n\nSo really, who are you to judge drug addicts, sadness addicts, and who am I to judge \"go getters\" or people absorbed in their drug of socializing?\n\nPS: Keep in mind that I am 19 years old, and it is possible that I could be wrong and turn into a social life addict like you guys some day.", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"subreddit": "reddit.com", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 6, "author": "Noexit", "created_utc": "1193257774", "children": [{"controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1427425541, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "archived": true, "name": "t1_c02b4br", "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5z054", "downs": 0, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02b4br", "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": "1193260326", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_c02b3za", "body": "&gt;Yeah, she's a sure bet, but you're going to regret it later.\n\n\nTo paraphrase G.O.B from Arrested Development \"Why is sex always good with the crazies?\"", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "ups": 6, "name": "t1_c02b3za", "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5z054", "retrieved_on": 1427425545, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02b3za", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "parent_id": "t1_c02b0tu", "body": " \"If you are depressed, get help.

Its an adaptive test, so if you answer the first question (which is average difficulty) correctly, it will give you a harder one.  If you get the first 5 correct, you are placed in the top tier of questions and would probably have to put significant effort in thereafter to get below a 700.  So take your time on those.  \r\nAlso, go in relaxed.  If you spend $5k on prep, not only are you wasting your money, but you will also likely be more nervous, since you spent so much money prepping.\r\n\r\nBottom line:  be calm, take a number of practice tests, prep courses are about as necessary as snake-oil, and work your hardest on the first 5 questions.

Education isn't a large concern either, I refuse to be another person over 30 who got passed on a promotion because they didn't have an MBA so I've set aside about 5K to prep for the GMAT and have started networking with higher-ups for references.  I've become a lot more pragmatic in relationships and the women I chase after.

Follow your own road\" is pertinent. However, \"Wise men learn by other men's mistakes, fools by their own.\" \r\n\r\nFriends: keep in touch. Make an effort to do so. \r\n\r\nMarriage/Dating: Make sure you genuinely like the person you are with. This sounds dumb but it is possible to love someone and not like them.\r\n\r\nLocation: Live somewhere you have never been before. If you are a country girl/boy, move to the city and vice versa. At a minimum, move to a different geographic region of the country you are living in. Best scenario is to live in a different country altogether. \r\n\r\nMilitary: It's not for everyone but if you can, do it. Short tours still count. It'll suck but you'll be a better person for it in the long run.  \r\n\r\nJobs: You will probably end up working in a field that is completely unrelated to your training. Cope. It's going to happen (on average) 3 more times. As long as you genuinely enjoy what you do, life will be better. When the bad days start outnumbering the good ones over a two month period\u2026 look for something else. \r\n\r\nEntertainment: Turn off your TV. If you don\u2019t own one, don\u2019t buy one. You won\u2019t miss it.\r\n\r\nElse:\r\na): Never be ashamed to tell someone \"I love you.\" Tell parents/spouse/girlfriend this if you mean it.\r\nb) If you can swing it, pay for dinner for everyone at the table. This will come back to you four fold the next time you are out.\r\nc) Question getting mad. It's hard to rationalize when the jerk-off in front of you on the interstate just cut you off, but there might be a reason. People are (generally) good and recognize their mistakes after the fact. I\u2019ve gained more by not getting pissed then I ever have by throwing a temper-tantrum.\r\nd) You can never have too much rope\u2026 or ketchup.\r\n", "author_flair_css_class": null}
