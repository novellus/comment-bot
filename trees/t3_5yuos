This is false.  Homeopathy is bunk because it is a heap of pseudoscientific drivel.  If someone proves that water has memory, that does not make homeopathy valid, as homeopathy comes with a large volume of nonsense.  Also, homeopathy being bunk doesn't imply that water doesn't have memory.\n\nIt is physically conceivable for water to have memory, because water is made of molecules which are made of particles which can be in various configurations and thus encode data.  The question is : do such structures exist, can they survive ordinary thermal agitation, and can they interact with living things?  Those are perfectly valid scientific questions I would like to see answered.\n\nLet's not throw the baby of water memory with the bathwater of homeopathic nonsense!\n ", "author": "obdurak", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "id": "c02arn3", "subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "name": "t1_c02arn3", "parent_id": "t3_5yuos", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}
