The situation he describes with 'Moderate Islam' came about, in part, due to the very same Turkish 'establishment's efforts to deal with the extreme left in the 70s by tacidly encouraging movements with strong religious elements.  The US was very much on the side of the Turkish establishment back then to the point of backing coups d'etat against the organized left.  (Remember this was around the time the US and OBL were on the same side and Islam was favored as an antidote to the Communists.)  People remember some of this, and they probably make up more then what they can remember.  He's out of his depth about the Kurds also.  Turkish government's distrust of the Kurdish minority cannot be understood w/o going back to the 1920s and reviewing the mechanism through which the Mosul province was ceded to the Brits.  All IMHO, but I am Turkish and arguably have a better vantage point than the ATimes author.  \n\nAnyway.  It is tough to give a good alternative summary so I won't attempt it.
