And not exactly BS.\n\nI wrote a fairly detailed response to this over a year ago in another forum.  The gist is quite simple:\n\nThe real talent of the \"hypnotist\" isn't that he gets some schmuck to believe that he's in a video game.  The brilliant thing is that he gets *us*, the audience, to believe that the schmuck believes he is in a video game.\n\nIf you view the video with a critical eye towards the behavior of the schmuck, does it  *really* look like he believes he's in a video game or does it *really* look like he's just scared out of his mind because he's in a fucked up situation in general?\n\nThere's no arguing that he's scared.  But does he believe he's in a \"zombie\" game?  That's the question... and the true power of suggestion is that the audience is *told* that he does, but that fact is never verified, yet *we* believe that he believes that he's in a zombie video game and thus *we* are the real schmucks.\n\nMake sense?", "author": "architectzero", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c029ykb", "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c029ykb", "parent_id": "t3_5ymfh", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}
