I don't spend anywhere nearly enough to qualify for the black one, and I'm not sure I'd step up if I did, but the platinum is definitely worth it IF you travel frequently. Among other things, it gets you into several airline clubs for free. Most airlines charge about $300 a year for that, which is 3/4 of the platinum fee, so you're ahead already if you enter at least two clubs, or use any other features.\n\nThe platinum card also has a pretty generous companion airfare program -- basically, buy biz class or better, and you get a second ticket free on some routes. There's also a domestic companion fare deal that you can use a few times a year (the ticket you're buying must be like $300 or more, I think). \n\nThere's also a concierge service, which is hit and miss except for the fact that you can use them as your GoogleSlave to help you find things in strange cities.
