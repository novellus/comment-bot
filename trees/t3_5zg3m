Surely not.  Whereas the government might have forgotten that, lots of soldiers do not.  People want to make this big deal about \"why dont the soldiers refuse to fight?  arent they smart enough to know better?\"  Its simple, as soon as the military starts making political policy it stops being the military and starts being the government.  \n\nDo you really want the military to tell you how to live?  Of course not.  \n\nNow, i am sure their are quite a few soldiers who enlisted for the reasons you mentioned, but i dont believe all, or even most, are like that.  The ones who are usually dont make it a career because they get washed out.  For green troops its ok to be a little overzealous, even encouraged.

If you like guns you can buy one.  While that doesn't mean everyone in the army isn't a sadist, it's a far cry away from being the other way around.\n\nNeither of our anecdotal evidence lends creedence to either of our views.  It could as easily be that the occupations turns them into sadists, as opposed to sadists seeking out this occupation, and as luck would have it, there's a whole wealth of studies to show that there's a large possibility that the circumstances surrounding these men and women turn them into what they are.

Which turns into an authoritarian attitude.\n\nI don't mean to diminish what you give up for your service.

Why would someone voluntarily let themselves be used by a larger organization that quite obviously doesn't care about the individual.\n\nI honestly don't mean to bash. I genuinely do not understand the mentality that would make someone believe joining the army is a good idea.\n\n\\Edit: In conclusion the type of mentality prevalent among Blackwater personnel seems to be rooted long before those people got where they are.\n\nI also don't mean to suggest everyone in the military is inherently evil and inhuman. It's just that those seem to be the requirements of an ideal soldier.\n\nI mean surely during your service you were put in positions that tugged on your conscience.
