Let's look at two cases: transcoding lossy to lossless (e.g. MP3 -&gt; Flac), and lossy to another lossy (e.g. Mp3 @128 kbps -&gt; MP3 @320 kbps).\r\n\r\nCase 1: Lossy to lossless\r\nThis should be easier to detect because there are some things you can look at in a frequency graph of a file to determine if it was transcoded (highpass,lowpass frequencies etc)-- even this isn't a trivial task because of the growing sophistication in the psymodels of the lossy codecs, and the wide variety of techniques a coec uses.\r\nIt'd be easier if a user had the same CD. he could then rip it and compare the audio data. but again, this is not as simple as it sounds because\r\n\r\n- We need the EXACT same version (no remasters etc). this isn't always possible\r\n- We need to take the drive offset into account. If the offset hasn't been corrected, the rip will be different (MD5s won't match) even if it was ripped from a cd. \r\n\r\nWe thus have a high tendency to get false positives. EAC logs aren't immune either- fake logs can be \"easily\" generated. So you NEED to compare it with your own rip.\r\n\r\nNote: there is a tool called auCDtect which is used as the backend by a lot of tools that aim to determine whether a lossless file was lossy sourced. If you read around, it's *quite* good, but not good enough to use it as a gold standard. It tends to give a lot of false positives.\r\n\r\nCase 2: lossy to lossy\r\nAFAIK, this is impossible to detect. You can't \"compare audio data\" because using the same switches could result in a different file if we have different encoder versions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn short, detecting transcoded/fake stuff is a pretty damn difficult business. Given the size of oink, i'd wager that a significant amount of fakes weren't detected.

After finding a bunch of fake EAC Log files, i downloaded a lossless copy of an album i owned. I made sure it was the exact same \"edition\" etc, and using foobar's bitcompare tool, i immediately found that the files were different. In addition, after ripping it securely with EAC, the CRCs didn't line up either.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, their rule stating that Mp3s need to be atleast 192 kbps (IIRC), is a good start, but there's just NO way they can prevent transcodes from appearing. Given that having a good ratio was a constant concern for many users, i wouldn't doubt that a lot of them took the liberty of transcoding an album they had to 320 kbps to get extra \"credit\".\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, Oink was a good place to find quite rare music, and they did take *some* steps towards having a quality control... but if you're looking for properly ripped and genuinely lossless files, there are better sites out there.
