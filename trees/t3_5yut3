Why aren't we all wearing saffron robes and laughing?\" Might I be so bold as to offer one explaination? The answer lies in one word; \"possessions\". In my life, I've been both middle class and flat broke poor. When I was middle class I owned a lot of things. These things constantly caused worry, from bills to concerns of ID theft. Back then I hardly noticed the constant frisson of fear and worry that surrounded me and controlled my actions. Then I became poor. This condition carried it's own set of problems, but also an unexpected benefit in that I was now free of debt and useless things cluttering my day. I was at peace for the first time in years. I learned that, though poor, I could still survive quite well, all it took was a little enginuity. But the most important thing I learned was that I'm here for a reason and that the world really isn't out to get me after all. Whatever it is that organizes life, call it God or what have you, merely needed me to slow down and smell the coffee. I'm happy to say my life is greatly improved now, as is my economic condition. More importantly, I still carry the peace that was given me when impovershed. I now have a monkish smile for the world. Bottom line: it appears you must lose it all to win it all.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
