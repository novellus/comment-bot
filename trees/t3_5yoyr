That tax is 12.5% on the first $96k of income, or something like that, I forget the exact amount. But, it amounts to no more than $12k out of the employer's pocket. In general, the _net_ tax on income in the U.S. is around 20%-30%, but it can be much higher or lower if you are particularly bad or good at your tax planning. In my experience, you pay no more in taxes when you are self-employed because you have access to many more deductions, but YMMV.\n\nWhat makes the largest difference in salary versus contracted revenues is benefits, particularly health benefits. If you're young and healthy, contracting is usually a net win  to the tune of maybe $10,000.\n\nSo, if you're making $70,000 contracting, then you should expect to make about $55,000 on salary, give or take.\n\nMy personal contracting salary was about $160,000 and when I accepted a full-time offer, I converted that to be about $130,000. I accepted something somewhat lower than that, but it includes an excellent stock and bonus package that should more than make up the difference.\n\nActual education makes a difference, the degree much less so. I've got about 13 years of experience and no college degree, but I have over 140 hours of  coursework and about 1/3rd of a Ph.D. degree in mathematics. I'm an educated, articulate person and that comes through in interviews.\n\nYou can and should self-educate, however.\n\nAlso, pay attention to the labor market. If you're living in Des Moines because that's where you were raised and you can't imagine living anywhere else, then you're eventually going to end up working for.. uhm.. Wells Fargo? I think that's the 1 big company there. You'll be lucky to ever make $70,000.\n\nSilicon Valley, Seattle, New York, Washington D.C., Atlanta, and Boston are all MUCH, MUCH better labor markets and you will end up wealthier if you move there earlier in your career.

So sorry, but I'm not in the mood for editing, so here's my answer and apparently my life story.\n\nCurrently I'm running a two-man consulting company with my former CTO, \"MM\". We're doing a short-term project for a bank (ca. 2 months) for $215 per hour. This is high even for me, my last gig paid $148 per hour. Don't know how much I'll get for the entire year since I've only worked for three months since I came home from travelling after uni (up to $47k before taxes atm).\n\nLearned to read when I was 5 (upside down at first, since I sat across my two year older brother watching him do his homework). Punched in my first program from a magazine when I was 6 (on an ZX Spectrum. Made a text-version space invaders clone when I was 11. Ripped off my friends by programming a slightly predictable roulette game when I was 12. Played around making demos in Pascal until I was 15. Used Visual C++ to program an Angband bot, mini-games and backdoor programs to mess with my mates in high school.\n\nDidn't really know what I wanted to do, so got a data-entry job after high school. Met MM, the CTO and one of the founders of the company, who offered me a job as a programmer. $60k per year. He was an incredibly skilled programmer and designer and taught me how to be a great programmer. I also read and read and read and read everything about design, programming and programmers I could manage. Was living with my gf for a period with a two hour commute each way, always carrying around a fat stack of articles to read on the bus.\n\nWorked there for almost four years, earning about $75k the last year as a tech lead on a medium sized project, being one of the two top programmers in the company. MM was forced out by some venture capitalists, so got a new CTO, who taught me how to be a manager. He allowed me to try myself as a tech lead and coached me through it. He wasn't very technically skilled though, and changed the strategy of the firm in a way I didn't like (e.g. porting everything from Linux to Windows). In addition, the other programmers got paid a lot more than me, even though I created more value than most of them, so I got sick and quit.\n\nWent to Uni for fun for three years after that. Was allowed to replace all the first-year units and some of the second year units with my own choices. Tried to do as many hard courses as I could, e.g. advanced algorithms, compiler construction, functional programming, mathematics, etc. This was easier than what I'd been doing the last three years so had a lot of fun in the sun. The amount of vacation you get is awesome.\n\nNow I'm planning to \"retire\" when I'm 35. Of course I'll never really retire, since I love programming, but I want to be able to spend a lot of time with my wife, kids, charities etc. \n\nSo wrapping up with some advice for the smart, demotivated kids: Set yourself a goal, work hard as hell, become one of the best in your field, keep current, learn how to sell yourself or associate yourself with someone who can. You'll get the freedom to get the jobs you want (that are fun) and obviously lots of cash.\n\n", "author": "theconsultant", "created_utc": "1192838918", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c02a6f0", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2fwo", "name": "t1_c02a6f0", "parent_id": "t3_5yoyr", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}

Consulted for 20 years with a small national software consulting firm (part owner).\n\nFor everyone claiming a $200/hour consulting assignment (by the way thats $400K/year) there are 1000 others just making a regular wage.  Starting salaries for software engineers are $50K USD + about $2,500 per year additional for each year of experience.  Just check out the salary articles in the trade papers that come out every year.  You can also check out the salary sites here on the web.  Yes, there are exceptions, but ask yourself, how many banks (or whatever) have projects that they are going to supplement their internal staffs with consultants at $200/hour, or just farm out the entire job?? not that many!\n\nThe Fortune 500 firm I work at requires an Engineering BS (EE, Math, Physics, CS, etc.) just to get the interview, from a real university and they check. BS MIS or whatever and no cigar, and yes - we loose out on a lot of talent that way, but that is what HR does (they do not care).  \n\nFor those at the $200/hour mark, on average for every hour at that rate there is another hour at marketing and managing yourself - so your real rate is $100/hour (unless they charge the customer the time - which is not fair).  Then after benefits (vacation, sick time, health &amp; dental insurance, life and accident insurance, liability insurance (errors &amp; omissions)), billing your time, continuing education, collecting, and all the rest, your south of $80/hour ($160K). \n\nI have met one person in my 30 years that did not have a BS - only a high school graduate, who was exceptional (and was one of Boeing's top engineers), and he was retiring after 35 years.\n\nA BS degree is your entry ticket - shows you can think for the most part.  There has to be something to filter the resumes on.  Every kid out of college wants to be the VP in a year, and is a self-proclaimed programming guru. There are some, but not really that many. \n\nThus, for the most part - after about 10 years if your over $100K - and still programming (you are usually in management at that level), you are really the exception.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
