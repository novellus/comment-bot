I am most certainly not a legal expert, but I'd be very surprised if marriage law wasn't considered a completely separate entity from contract law.\n\nThere may be some superficial similarities, but you should be cautious about taking those too far.", "author": "depleater", "created_utc": "1193449563", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c02blkq", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "ups": 0, "parent_id": "t1_c02bki0", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "name": "t1_c02bki0", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 2, "link_id": "t3_5z3rb", "retrieved_on": 1427425260, "body": "Unfortunately, as it was quite concise, it appeared to me that you were quibbling more about the use of the word people than about the government's right to decide who gets to sign legal documents.\r\n\r\nIn general, I agree with you about blanket statements; but I also think there is a point where excessive specificity ruins the conversation.  \r\n\r\nHowever, for the benefit of making two points with one comment, the government of the United States of America has a pre-existing set of rules to determine which people that reside within the borders of the United States of America (and its territories) may legally enter into a contract with another party that may or may not reside within the borders of the United States of America (and its territories).

In fact, there are plenty of churches out there that perform gay marriage (in places where it's legal), so it appears to be sanctified enough to me.\n\n&gt;If we allow same-sex marriages, then we will have to allow all.\n\nPlease clarify.  What do you mean by \"all\"?\n\n&gt;Same-sex marriage is not marriage\n\nTell that to the churches that marry people of the same sex.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": -11, "name": "t1_c02be9m", "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5z3rb", "retrieved_on": 1427425341, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02be9m", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5z3rb", "body": "I believe in the sanctity of marriage.
