The Russian had good reason to be afraid. He was walking around Vienna with blueprints for a nuclear bomb.\n\nTo be precise, he was carrying technical designs for a TBA 480 high-voltage block, otherwise known as a \u201cfiring set\u201d, for a Russian-designed nuclear weapon. He held in his hands the knowledge needed to create a perfect implosion that could trigger a nuclear chain reaction inside a small spherical core. It was one of the greatest engineering secrets in the world, providing the solution to one of a handful of problems that separated nuclear powers such as the United States and Russia from rogue countries such as Iran that were desperate to join the nuclear club but had so far fallen short.\n\nThe Russian, who had defected to the US years earlier, still couldn\u2019t believe the orders he had received from CIA headquarters. The CIA had given him the nuclear blueprints and then sent him to Vienna to sell them - or simply give them - to the Iranian representatives to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). With the Russian doing its bidding, the CIA appeared to be about to help Iran leapfrog one of the last remaining engineering hurdles blocking its path to a nuclear weapon. The dangerous irony was not lost on the Russian - the IAEA was an international organisation created to restrict the spread of nuclear technology.\n** ", "author": "slomo68", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "author_flair_css_class": null, "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c029st9", "parent_id": "t3_5yiw3", "score_hidden": false, "id": "c029st9"}
