The new details could fuel debate over whether Israel's attack was warranted.\n\nIsrael, is a regional hegemon, thus like the US who has a global hegemon position, favors unilateral approaches, everyone else be damned.  This is why it didn't report a potential violation by Syria to IAEA regulations rather it just decided to strike.\n\nOne issue with Israel going to the IAEA is that Israel has no credibility with the IAEA.  Israel spent years deceiving international (primarily American) inspectors and lying to the world about its nuclear program:\n\n&gt; While Iran long accepted UN nuclear supervision, Israel flatly refused UN inspection, even creating in 1969 a fake control room at its main Dimona reactor, according to defector Mordechai Vanunu, to fool US specialists in the only inspection it ever allowed.\n\nDon't be fooled into think this is about democracy promotion or human rights, it is about geopolitical power.
