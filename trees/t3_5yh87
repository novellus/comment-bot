Retarded.\" isn't quite how I'd qualify people's inability to grasp the severity of this situation. Denial is a very normal and understandable reaction to a reality a rapidly diminishing resources, particularly ones with traditions of abundance, namely food, energy, and water. The very notion of our so-called modern and technologically sophisticated society running out of an elemental resource like water goes against everything we are taught to believe about where we stand as a civilization at the top of the evolutionary pyramid. In short, these things are supposed to happen. So when they do, it forces us to face a reality that is in severe contrast to what we've come to believe about being above such simplistic concerns such as water. These are problems for the 3rd World, not the US. \n\nThis of course does not excuse people from acting ignorantly in the face of such a monumental problem, but it does go far in explaining why people choose to remain oblivious to the issue.", "author": "blenderhead", "created_utc": "1192638047", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_5yh87", "id": "c029onh", "author_flair_css_class": null}
