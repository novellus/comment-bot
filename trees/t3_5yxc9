This country jails more people than any other nation IN THE WORLD.  \r\n\r\nQuit wasting my tax money locking up nonviolent drug offenders who often come out worse than they went in.\r\n\r\n", "author": "tracii1984", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "name": "t1_c02aueq", "parent_id": "t3_5yxc9", "id": "c02aueq", "author_flair_css_class": null}
