Economic theory has contrived a species it calls Homo economicus\u2014a \u201crational maximiser\u201d who grabs what he can for himself. But, curiously, he makes no appearance in the ultimatum game, a classic economics experiment.\n\nIn this game, two players, a proposer and a responder, divide a reward. It could be a cake. It could be cash. It could even be a bunch of grapes. The game is so named because the proposition is an ultimatum. The responder can either accept the division or reject it. If he rejects it, both players receive nothing.\n\nHomo economicus would accept any division in which his share was not zero. But that is not what happens. Scores of studies have run the ultimatum game across cultures and ages. Universally, people reject any share lower than 20%\u2014apparently to punish the greed of the proposer. People do not act like Homo economicus. Instead, they are the arbiters of fairness.\n\n", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5ybq9", "id": "c029adz", "author_flair_css_class": null}

For the fans, however, there's an incentive to pay nothing and hope that everybody else ponies up. That way you get more Radiohead in the future without paying a red cent.\n\nI'm appalled that they quoted an economist saying \"we don't understand tipping.\" We do. I'd venture to guess that Mankiw and Rodrik understand tipping very well, and this reporter just wanted a juicy, out of context quote. What Mankiw was probably getting at is that this is not tipping in the traditional sense.", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1427426358, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "archived": true, "name": "t1_c029da4", "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5ybq9", "downs": 0, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c029da4", "author": "breakneckridge", "created_utc": "1192484901", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t1_c029are", "body": "I downloaded the album, but didn't pay for it.\n\nWhy?  Because I'm not really a big radiohead fan (gasp!).  So since there was absolutely no bar or stigma to downloading their album to see if I like it, I decided to give it a try.  And that is the single MOST important thing any artist needs in order to sell their music today - ears willing to listen and give their music a try!\n\nAs it turns out, I don't really like this album more than their others, so I'm not going to listen to it again, and I'm not going to pay for it.  But had it turned out that I enjoyed the album, then I would've paid for it (which you can do later without redownloading).  Which would've meant one more album sale they received that they almost definitely wouldn't have made had I not been able to download it first.\n\nSo it's somewhat, but not quite like a tipping situation.  It's more like a band that plays for free in the park everyday.  Sure, you can go listen to them in the park for free whenever you like, but if you don't pay them when they pass around the hat at the end of the performance then you risk them deciding it's not worth it to play in your park anymore.  \n\nSo paying for an album after you already have it in your computer is in part a payment to ensure that the producers of that music continue to deliver more music you like it the future.\n\nSo it's kind of a combination between tipping, paying to ensure future good products are available, and eating a free cheese sample at the supermarket.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 20, "name": "t1_c029are", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5ybq9", "retrieved_on": 1427426391, "score_hidden": false, "body": "Normally I'm not the type to talk as if I know what I'm talking about, especially negatively.\n\nBut even as a relative economic layman, I think I can say this article is full of fail.\n\nThe \"optional\" payment, which let's just call tipping, is not about warm fuzzy feelings.  It is not a charity, so their test demonstrating people's reasoning with the \"save children\" donation is not an accurate representation of what we're seeing here.  Why are they different?  With a donation charity such as the one described, the benefit to cost ratio for an individual is so close to zero (the nigh imperceptible, though admittedly real, benefit to the whole of society), that there is no immediate benefit to the donator himself for giving the money.    \n\n\nRadiohead's \"tip\" system is something else entirely.  Yes, currency is something you exchange for goods and services.  That we know.  From that point of view, paying less is always better for the consumer.  But currency is also a vote, a statement of endorsement.  It's a Pavlovian instigator for service rendered.  \n\nI tip the hairstylist after a good cut.  She's rewarded for good action.  She's more likely to try harder with my hair in the future.  By association, that connection is also demonstrated in front of her compatriots.  So they too are likely to make the association between good cut (extra effort) and good money.\n\nIt's also a vote for non-tip payment events.  For example, there's now a chance of a Serenity 2 because the first run of Serenity dvd's sold out.  Company sees profitability, hence is more likely to follow up with similar content.  A very successful movie of type A is likely to generate additional movies of type A from other directors as well.\n\nWhen we pay for downloading Radiohead's music, it's a vote.  We are voting for a system, a system which we hope to be implemented in a broader scale.  Not voting by not paying does not endeavor to encourage the system to thrive. \n", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5ybq9", "id": "c029are", "author_flair_css_class": null}

Irrational? I too agree with many on the comment thread regarding a defense that this is not irrational behavior, even in an economic sense. Legal or otherwise, if one puts things out to be paid for, by donation if you will, and due to the scarcity of resources, if donations do not at least match the spending required to put out the product, then the product will go away, or something else will have to be thought of or changed, so that those resources are available.\n\nWhat I find most irrational, is the argument that it's then rational, to only pay what is legally allowed for. We can only look at our education system in the USA to see how well that really works out, even if only from an economic sense. We pay what we have to, legally, and that's it. What have we come up with? Children, who grow into adults, with fewer internal resources to provide for better economy in general, thus we all suffer. At least we're getting what we pay for.\n\nAnd tipping? I'm a waiter. My base salary is just over $3 an hour now. There's no way I would work as a waiter, if people only paid what they legally had to. Waiters would disappear, so economists would have to cook for themselves all the time. No services would be rendered at all.\n\nWow! I'm guess our education system, regarding what the author and associated economists have said, is proof we are getting what we pay for.
