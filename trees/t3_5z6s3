Dennis Kucinich describes the process of how, within a few weeks, he'll force the issue of impeachment on the floor of the U.S. House. He does this to inform the public so that the public can assist in the process. The likely scenario is that a congressperson will immediately make a parliamentary move to 'table' the motion. The vote on whether to 'table' the impeachment motion WILL BE THE IMPORTANT VOTE. If the motion is tabled, it's dead. So, Kucinich is calling on every citizen (yes, that means you) to contact their representative to tell them to vote NOT to table the impeachment motion, but to let it be discussed on the floor of the U.S. House!
