It pays to listen to the menu options because you can spend 20 mins on hold for a department that can't assist you because you jumped ahead and pressed the wrong option.\r\n\r\n2) Bail out of voice jail - This one seems very much in conflict with #1 and should be used only when you know the menu options cannot assist you. Otherwise, you're tying up the line for someone who actually needs to speak with a human being. Or, as is the case with #1, you can wind up holding for the wrong department.\r\n\r\n3) Take names. This is helpful in establishing a record of your phone calls, however, most companies don't care if the rep gave you wrong info. Of course, if the info you were given caused an error, then you would typically be compensated, however, most companies keep a record of this information anyway. In fact, I can't think of a single where knowing the name and id# of the rep you spoke with actually solved anything. \r\n\r\n4) Have pity. This one is very important. Not that you have to treat us like important people, just as human beings. I can't tell you how many times I've bent over backwards and circumvented policies for customer who I felt deserved it. I've also benefitted from this approach as a customer, as Toshiba is currently replacing a $2300.00 HDTV that is six months out of warranty! The power of persuasion really lies in a tactful approach. Of course, this only works if the rep you're dealing with isn't a complete moran, in which case you ask for a supervisor immediately.\r\n\r\nThat's my humble opinion based on what I've observered in the last 5 years. \r\n\r\nOne last thing I forgot the mention. This just came to me as I was trying to assist someone who wouldn't let me speak. I'd like to add one:\r\n\r\n5.) Listen - Everyone loves to talk about themselves. In fact, as I write this, I am talking about myself (er job at least). While I'm sure much of what you have to say is important, let the representative respond. More often than not, the voluntary information given to me is not needed and just wastes time. I can't tell you how many times I've forgotten to mention something to a customer just because I couldn't get a word in with them and was distracted with the notion that they wouldn't let me talk. Finally, providing an answer before the rep finishing asking the question (cutting them off) does not make you look clever. It only makes you look like an asshole and may lead to shitty service if the rep is a jerk as well.", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "name": "t1_c02bqw8", "parent_id": "t3_5z9g2", "id": "c02bqw8", "author_flair_css_class": null}
