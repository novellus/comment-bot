Deep Linking is when you link to a web page within a site other than the home or a major section page. Hot Linking is when you embed a resource from another site on your own site without re-hosting the media yourself.\n\nI'm for deep linking except where someone is abusing your content like linking to search results on your site by spidering every form field value.\n\nI'm ok with hot linking when credit is given and single-click link to the hosting server is provided. Flickr thumbnail galleries, most video embeds, JavaScript search widgets from Google are technically hot linked but they all link to the hosting site and give them full credit.\n\nWhat TV Links failed to do was link to the appropriate Veoh.com and Google Video pages for the FLVs they were playing on their site, within their own Flash video player. Since Veoh has MD5 type hash in their FLV url, there is practically no way to find the web page for a given Veoh video via it's FLV url. It's not easy for average users to find the Google Videos page for a given video that TV Links embedded. Submitters would upload a \"Seinfeld\" episode to Veoh and title it \"DFPGDSFY4353FG\" to ensure nobody can ever find it on the hosted site. Then they submit it to TV Links and title it \"Seinfeld Season 3, Episode 6.\" Veoh and Google Videos have enough on their hands already and since we don't have good video fingerprinting technology yet, these videos would never be found and completely ignored.\n\nTV Links could have easily placed the original Veoh/Google/YouTube embeds on their site but they directly hot-linked the FLVs. They reason they did this is of course to prevent copyright owners from easily finding the source of the video because then they would just click the \"Copyright Claim\" buttons.\n\nCopyright is a complex issue and as someone that runs a video site, I feel bad for the TV Links guy. I know there was a lot of wonderful content on TV Links but I'd say 99% of it was illegal. Only reason TV Links became so popular is because most of the vidoes worked and weren't deleted instantly because of the aforementioned reasons. Why did TV Links stay up so long? I don't know. Personally, I'd like for TV Links to come back but if it does, what message does it send to others? That as long as you upload illegal content on server A and link to it from server B, it's acceptable?", "author_flair_css_class": null}
