The picture that graces the cover is stunning, your text is flawless and your graphic designs are a sure fire way to impact anyone who reads it. However, there is only one tiny little problem\u2026who do you mail it to? Postcard design means nothing if the person reading it does not want or need your product/service! Too many businesses, be it large corporations or small businesses, spend too much time designing a perfect postcard and not nearly enough time figuring out the mailing list. It would be better to send out a postcard that is ill designed to the right people then it would be to send out a great looking postcard to the wrong people!\n\nFor example, if you are marketing your house painting services, you don\u2019t want to just mail your postcards to every address in the area you are targeting. You may end up putting postcards in condo mailboxes, apartment complexes and townhouses where the owners have zero control over the color of their house and zero need for your service. When you market this way you are just throwing money away because that\u2019s exactly where these people will put your postcard- in the trash!\n\nInstead, you want to make sure you are mailing to a list a people or businesses that will have an interest in what you\u2019re offering. To get good response rates you have to accurately target good prospects for your business. How do you do this?  Well, step one is to research your current customer base. What demographics are you dealing with (typically you will look at their age, location, average income, etc..). Next, work with your list provider to get a mailing list of people or businesses meeting the same criteria.\n\nCactus Mailing can help you and your business get better response rates by accurately targeting good prospects for your business.
