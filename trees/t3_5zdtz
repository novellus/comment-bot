Encoding all of it via markup would require a very\n  fine level of detail, not to mention /awareness/ of issues so widely\n  dispersed in the population that only a handful of people per\n  million grasp them.  Therefore, to be successful, there must be an\n  upper limit to the complexity of the language defined with SGML, and\n  one must go on to solve the next problem, not sit idle with a set of\n  great tools and think \"I ought to use these tools for something\".\n  Stultifying as the language of content models may be, it amazes me\n  that people do not grasp that they need to use something else when\n  it becomes too painful to express with SGML, but I am in the highly\n  privileged position of knowing a lot more than SGML when I pronounce\n  my judgment on XML.  For one thing, I knew Lisp before I saw SGML,\n  so I know what brilliant minds can do under optimal conditions and\n  when they ensure that the problem is still bigger than the solution.
