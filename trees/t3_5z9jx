One time a girl with whom I was having a relationship called me in tears because she thought I didn't care about her.  The reason she thought this is because she saw my computer screen and observed that her screen name was at the bottom of my AIM buddy list.  \n\nShe assumed that because she ranked her list in some priority order, I must as well, and the fact that she was at the bottom meant I didn't care about her, or worse.\n\nI -- as calmly as possible -- tried to explain that the top *and* bottom of my list are where I place the people with whom I communicate the most.  It's easy to scan with your eyes to the top and bottom of a window.\n\nAccordingly, the people I talk with most are near the top and bottom, while he people I never talk to are in the middle of my list, probably in a group that's \"collapsed\" (group name shown but not contacts).\n\nYes, this really happened.  We had a 2 hour conversation on the phone.  She even called my friend beforehand to ask him if she was being reasonable (he told her no).

A person who *ever* thought that clothes left on the floor are *\"a symbol of how he didn't care enough about me\"* sounds pretty batshit fucking insane to me.  Maybe that woman is determined but she is definitely not rational.\n\nThen again I guess a lot of American women are that way these days.  I'm American; just saying.  \n\nI think it has something to do with the diamonds they all want.  Some kind of culture of self-centered-ism.  The American consumer culture encourages young girls to think of themselves as princesses who should be whisked away and pampered, to whom is *owed* some preconceived life with prince charming, a big rock, a fancy wedding.  It teaches them to be unrealistic about life and personal relationships.  It is evident in this woman's thinking -- the fact that she would view another person's laziness (clothes on floor) as a *personal* affront to her reflects the self-centered view with which she views the world.\n\nI'm not even an old person, and I don't want to tout the argument of \"it's the pop media's fault\" (TV, movies), but I really think all those Disney princess movies and romantic comedies encourage women *and* men to stereotype themselves and others.  It sets up elaborate preconceptions of how things should be, like courting, that are not realistic but yet can be very difficult to break.\n\nShould the American Man pay for everything, open the door for her, spend 3 mos salary on a diamond ring?  All this culture tells her she's *owed* these things.  She is inherently deserving of this because she exists; she is the protagonist of the movie that is her life.\n\nUnfortunately this pop culture does not often represent the darker sides to life.  The elaborate conceptions of marriage and relationships come crashing down because they are not realistic.
