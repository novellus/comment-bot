However when what is being sent over their networks is causing service calls and bottlenecks they will intervene. Believe me, they take bottlenecks seriously because is causes a huge effort on the part on the carrier to determine and fix the problem. \r\nCase in point:\r\nYou have a neighborhood with 400 homes in it.

Hogbyte\u2019s a great guy, it\u2019s just that he has 4 PC\u2019s sitting behind a firewall in his house running 8 Torrent sessions 24/7 downloading who knows what. All of a sudden the carrier starts getting calls from the neighborhood complaining about slow download speeds even \u201ctiling\u201d (little squares)  on the TV during programs. They immediately dispatch techs to the houses and discover nothing is wrong. Then they come to me. Dude! What\u2019s going on with this segment? I put a sniffer on it and discover that one guy is using a ton of download bandwidth on that segment. What\u2019s worse he\u2019s using 30% of the upload bandwidth. \r\nSo now the carrier a choice to make. Add another segment to the neighborhood (at &gt;500k) or kill hogbyte. Which do you think they are going to take?  First they will call or mail a letter or warning, then they will throttle and lastly they will terminate service.\r\nThe same but different.\r\nSame neighborhood different plan.   Hogbyte moves in, buys a business plan. Network study says that traffic s heavy and nobody is really abusing.
