A lot of it.  I order loose tea in various flavor varieties online (I prefer cinnamon or mint) and I make Iced Tea and drink about 3 quarts a day.  \n\nI must admit, I haven't lost a pound.  So the whole \"weight loss supplement\" I would take with a grain of salt.  However I do highly recommend a good cold glass of Iced Tea over diet soda regardless.  \n\nhttp://www.stashtea.com/ - recommended for a great variety of different loose teas.  I've got a Mr. Coffee iced tea maker, and a goldplated basket I use to hold the loose teas as they brew.
