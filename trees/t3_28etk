Using that approach, I would predict that the next language is whatever was used to write the browser.  I base that on my impression that C's popularity in the past was that it was used to write the old PC operating systems.  That gave a C programmers the advantage of full access to the full operating system.  That one advantage trumped all of the (relatively minor) problems with writing stable C programs.\n\nI know, browsers aren't written in javascript but that's what's being offered to web programmers.
