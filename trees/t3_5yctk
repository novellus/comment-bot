I'm also shocked that kids are being used to push political/religious ideologies that they are often to young to fully understand in the first place.\nI suspect that somehow religious lobbies are pushing the story as an important society debate, which is clearly **not**.\n\n\"Reasonable accommodation\" as they call it, are pure *bullshit* (sorry this is the most accurate word I could find). Most immigrants say \nthat they don't even want those accommodation as they don't want to be treated differently than other citizens. \n\nThen you quickly realize that those who push for those accommodations are a small portion of the immigrants that happens to be religious extremisms. \n\nThe problem with the extremisms: they speak louder.\n\nNow in my country, a kid has the right to go to elementary school with a f*ckin' ** knife**, but it's not really dangerous because it's not *really* a knife, it's a \"religious symbol\".\nDoes it look like something reasonable ? Would you let your kid in a classroom with other kids that are potentially armed in the name of religion ?\n\nWhat will they want to bring next, stoning ? lashing ? [sharia](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4236762.stm) ?\n\nI cannot define myself as racist, but is there a term for those who hates all kind of religious extremism (even Catholic) ?\n\nLet's say pissed off atheist for the moment :p  ", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "ups": 2, "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5yctk", "retrieved_on": 1427426366, "body": " I think we have to draw a line here somewhere.

If she knows why she's doing it, cool.  \nModesty takes different definitions for all.  While for me, a girl in a bikini is modest, this doesn't go for everyone.  I would agree with anyone that modesty must also agree with actions, I don't see a problem with someone exercising both modesty in clothes and actions. \nI respect individual expressions.  I'm for civil liberties, and religious freedoms are pretty high up there.  \nYea, even though I find it kinda weird at times, and somewhat even exclusive, and I prefer someone identifying as human before anything else whether it be religion or nationality, I'm still for it.
