She broke loose and ran toward the barracks' parking lot, where he caught up with her and beat her with a pair of nunchucks.\r\n&gt;He then stuffed her into the trunk of his car and left her there while he cleaned up. Several hours later, he drove down Graham Road, past Loop Road and stopped near a bridge in Lonoke County. Green told investigators he put her body in the front seat and raped her because her body was still warm.\r\n&gt;He dragged Spencer out of his vehicle and put her in front of the car and ran over her several times, going back and forth. He then collected himself long enough to dump her body in Twin Prairie Bayou.\r\n&gt;This is what the Rev. Johnny Jackson, interim pastor at Bethel Baptist Church in Jacksonville, calls an accident, and apparently Huckabee believes him.\r\n\r\nHuckabee was prepared to grant this man clemancy for the \"accident\", refusing to discuss the case with the victim's family or to even give a reason, as required by Arkansas law.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that stopped him?
