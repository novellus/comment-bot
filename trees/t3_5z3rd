I learned to program around age 7. However, if we do take it as axiomatic that the earlier we teach kids to program, the better they'll be able to become at it, then we need to ask, \"What programming language is best for teaching elementary school age children?\" \n\nI'm 100% sure the answer is not C++, since C++ is too verbose, too speed focused, and too irregular to be worth teaching to kids. With adults, you can train them to dot their i's, cross their t's, and put a bibliography at the end of their papers. With kids, you have to explain each seemingly obvious step to them until they finally get into a position that they can master things on their own.\n\nAnyhow, BASIC worked for me back in the day. Nowadays, I think Python might be a good fit for older kids, who won't be as put off by pure text interfaces (since graphics are a bigger pain in Python than Apple BASIC), but younger kids should probably use some custom thing that can animate junk on screen easily.
