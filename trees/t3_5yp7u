There has *never existed* a nation that truly implements libertarian free-market, hands-off governmental principles. So, everyone from Mises and Ayn Rand to Freepers and the libertarians on Reddit is merely spouting economic and political *theory* that has never been tested empirically.\n\nSocial-democratic principles have consistently demonstrated that they work: the nations in western europe, Canada, Australia &amp; New Zealand are thriving and rated well by international metrics such as quality of life, health, personal liberty, human rights, etc. The US is much farther right wing than the rest of the first world, yet it is still pulled slightly to the left by a large part of the population. The New Deal, labour unions, civil rights movement and so on have been essential to political and economic  progress and security.\n\n**IF** libertarian policies are more attractive to capital than regulated markets, and **IF** they represent a more desirable environment in which to live for average workers and citizens, then it shouldn't be difficult to attract people to join a libertarian nation. \n\nSo, since libertarian principles should, in theory be appealing to those who own a great deal of wealth, *[go buy a country](http://www.neatorama.com/2007/01/04/the-5-smallest-countries-in-the-world/)*. Tuvalu or Nauru would probably be willing to sell for a few billion. Alternately, there have been various plans to build a floating independent city-state. Again, since capital should flock to this free environment from stifling regulated markets, *what's the hold-up*?\n\nBuy or build your nation, run it in pure libertarian style, and prove to the world that your theories work *in practice*.\n\nUntil then, stop claiming the rest of us are \"picking your pockets at gunpoint\". By living in a country with taxes, you agree to pay them. Most people in the 1st world don't want to live in a country where people starve because of economic hardship.\n\n", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5yp7u", "id": "c02a6cz", "author_flair_css_class": null}
