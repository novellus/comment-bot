The settlements are in disputed territory. The peace talks get nowhere because the Arabs want everything their own way without negotiations based on the facts.\n\nThe Balfour Declaration in 1917 authorized the settlement of Jews \"anywhere in Palestine.\" The League of Nations made the Balfour Declaration international law in 1922 and Britain compensated the Arabs with the east bank of the territory. The United Nations ratified the League of Nations decision in 1948 and made it part of their charter under Article 80. The charter is the constitution of the UN and any resolutions passed declaring the settlements \"illegal\" are unconstitutional.\n\nThe only borders of Israel are those set in 1947 when the Arabs were also awarded a state. They rejected their award and made war to get the whole ball of wax and were defeated. Thus emerged the 1967 ceasefire lines, which have no legal status at all.\n\nThe Arabs are stuck on stupid, engaging all the time like a broken record in lawyer talk, instead of sitting down, face reality, and negotiate with no preconditions. Yes there are two sides to this issue as well. \n\nThere are a quarter million Jews living in cities, town, and on farms in Judea and Samaria, with many industries and institutions, and if anyone in the world thinks these people are going to be displaced in a peace settlement, they are dreaming in color.
