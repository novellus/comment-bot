If its week 16 and the The Cheaters are 15-0, then I will admit it.\n\nCompetition is too tight in the NFL in this era for this. Someone will figure The Cheaters out. And it's really not that hard. Ball control. The Cheaters have yet to play a team with a secondary capable of matching up against them. Limit the time The Cheaters have the ball, don't turn it over, and put up over 20 points and it's very possible. Teams that have a chance to do this are: Indy, Pittsburgh, and Philly.
