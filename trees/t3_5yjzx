I challenge you to provide a source or even a quote from him that proves otherwise.\n\nHe's a Libertarian.  While there are many different factions of Libertarians, all typically believe that a completely free market is ideal.  What we've got now is not a true free market, but it's pretty close.\n\nGovernment oversight of industry continues to decrease, and Ron Paul is in favor of this, because he believes that a free market will work these issues out on their own.  Which, given the current trend, we can agree that this is not going to happen.  One corporation owns the infrastructure and they lease to the other in order not to get slapped with an anti-trust suit.  In a free market, you would get *exactly one* choice, and that is what essentially what Ron Paul favors.\n\nTo continue to reference an example that effects you personally:  I've got only two competitive cable internet providers in my market, and I live in one of the 5 largest cities in the US.  They both offer nearly identical pricing and services, and I don't have a choice, because in a metropolitan market in the US, I can almost guarantee that only one company owns that infrastructure.  This is a glimpse at the free market people like Ron Paul support - the fittest corporations survive, competition is eventually stifled; and you, the ever doting consumer, get cocked over.
