I'm fairly certain that his \"alien\" visit was little more than a drug fueled trip through Nepal.  And he pretty much admits to it in interviews:\n\n&gt;By 1994, it was becoming quite intense, I was doing nothing but magic every day. Because I was living on my own, the house had become this site of magical madness. So Kathmandu was this idea\u2026 My friend Ulric and I had seen this program on TV where some guy promised that if you went up the 365 steps of the Shwayambunath temple in Kathmandu without drawing a breath, you\u2019d achieve enlightenment in this life. So we turned up demanding enlightenment now! If it\u2019s that simple, let\u2019s do it! And we ran up the steps to the temple on a single breath, it was really easy. Enlightenment in this life is really easy, it turns out\u2014it\u2019s as simple as working a few muscles.\n&gt;\n&gt;But I wanted something to happen. I wanted the Buddha to descend on me, I wanted some kind of visionary experience. And on the last day in Kathmandu, I got the visionary experience like nothing I\u2019d ever known before or since. I was taken out of Four-D reality, shown the entire universe as a single object, shown the world as it is from outside, the viewpoint of the Supercontext as I called it in \u201cThe Invisibles,\u201d and it was profound. It was a shattering experience. It completely changed everything about how I viewed the world, life, death, time. [laughs] Whether it was real or not\u2026 You know, a lot of people say \u201cOh you were stoned weren\u2019t ya?\u201d and yeah, I took two little pieces of hash but\u2026I\u2019ve tried plenty of drugs before and since then and never been able to re-create the experience: not even with DMT, not even Salvia, any of these alien contact drugs. They\u2019re nothing like this. It didn\u2019t come with the hash, it was something else. It was something I\u2019d been waiting for, what Crowley would call the conversation with the Holy Guardian Angel. It feels like a contact with a future self, or with a self that exists outside time and space, in what Australian aborigines would call Aljira, the Dreamtime. Platonic reality. Which again is our translation of a word that is much more complex than \u201cDreamtime.\u201d I was taken to a place that was outside space and time, and shown space and time for what it is, a kind of nursery in which the larval forms of 5-D godlike intelligences are grown to adulthood. They said, \u201cSpace and time is place where you grow children, because only in Time do things grow.\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;So, the experience was immense and completely transformative, and in that sense, it\u2019s utterly real, whether or not you believe in aliens or in fifth dimensional beings or unfolded future selves. It doesn\u2019t matter. What this \u2018contact experience\u2019 does is re-create your entire relationship with everything around you. So in that sense, it\u2019s utterly real. There is something else going on beyond 11-bit consciousness\u2014everyone who explores \u2018magical\u2019 consciousness reports the same experiences. Philip K. Dick obviously had the same kind of experience in 1974. Alan Moore\u2019s obviously had the same experience, judging from his recent work. Robert Anton Wilson\u2019s obviously had the same experience. Buddha. Christ. Carlos Castaneda. David Icke! All these people offer corroboration and their own metaphors for framing the same experience. If Philip K. Dick says it\u2019s contact with a Vast And Living Intelligence System, if Alan Moore calls it Ideaspace, if Robert Anton Wilson says it\u2019s Cosmic Tricksters from Sirius, maybe we should just start accepting that certain types of thinking lead to a shift in consciousness which offers human minds a more inclusive view of Time, Space and Mind, and try to find ways to generate that kind of thinking in children at school.\n\nI've always found it interesting that he attributes one of his most successful works to a message from a higher being.

He then presented me with an Awake! pamphlet and said that I should read it.\r\n\r\nIf I recall correctly, this pamphlet is distributed by Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.  I\u2019ve seen them twice before, and one of them even gave me a book.  I think it\u2019s the artist that gives them away.  Normally, I\u2019m not the type to engage strangers with theological debate, particularly not old men, but normally I\u2019m not confronted by them either.  You can\u2019t just walk up to a person and punch them, expecting that they won\u2019t fight back.  The same is true of politics, abortion, and religion, which is why any self-respecting person should not bring the matters up in polite conversation, especially not to a stranger.\r\n\r\nWhen he started on his spiel that I was sure would take at least several minutes, I interjected:\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you believe in evolution?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe laughs politely and says no, he does not.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of different kinds of critters on this planet, how did Noah fit two of each on the arc then?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe laughs politely again, and informs me that Noah didn\u2019t bring them all, just one of each type (two dogs, two cattle, two bugs, etc., not all of the different species)\r\n\r\n\u201cSo then how do you explain the diversity of life on the world today?  I mean, wouldn\u2019t all dogs look the same?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe laughs politely once more, wishes me a good day, and leaves.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, he doesn\u2019t know the answer.  Why?  Because Noah\u2019s Arc is a fucking ridiculous story brought down by even the most basic logic.  But I\u2019m sure that, so conditioned is this gentleman, this is a question that will be immediately erased from his mind.  It\u2019s kind of funny, but mostly depressing to think that you can live sixty-five years, and have such an inability to cope with reality that your brain reconditions itself to only hear what it wants to hear.\r\n\r\nAfter getting off the light rail, I\u2019m walking the last few blocks to work, reading a book, with the pamphlet tucked underneath it.   A stranger at a corner accosts me and asks what I\u2019m reading, then seeing the pamphlet underneath the book, says something clever and witty.  I look at him, and he\u2019s carrying a stack of Awake! literature.  He was apparently curious as to what I was reading so he could segue into another spiel.  I nearly ask him the same Noah\u2019s Ark questions, but figure he won\u2019t know the answer either.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think is the cause of all of these Jehovah\u2019s Witness types?  Is it indoctrination, like the Mormons do with their children, is it their inability to explain the unknown, or a lack of being able to cope with death?  Do they need to fit in somewhere, and other nutjobs are the only types that will take them seriously?  Is it brainwashing?

I'm am 24 years old, and grew up in a Pentecostal household.  At the age of 14 I told my parents that I felt opressed by the church, and I wanted to see what other religions were like.  I went to churches of varying denominations (mostly of christian dogma) and determined I didn't like what I saw religion doing.  Once in college, I took philosophy and religion courses just to satisfy my curiosity, and try to justify my opinions.\n\nWhat I determined was that religion was CREATED as an \"organized\" governing body to help society stand behind a code of ethics. PERIOD.  \n\nWhat I further determined, was that my parents having forced me to go to church when I was younger only caused me to disregard faith even more as: pushed only by those ignorant (in the true sense of the word) of the fact that they control their future and what they become in life, offering hope for the LOST minds of the world.  \n\nReligion has many positive implications, and helps many people, however, it truly is not for everyone.  For those people who have faith in themselves that they can conquer all as long as they have a higher positive purpose, relgion is somewhat obsolete.\n\nI believe \"God\" is the energy in the world that is neither created nor destroyed.  Anyone can harness the energy.\n\nThere are several books I would recommend that cover this from a religious perspective.
