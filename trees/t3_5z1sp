If you could convince enough people to vote for RP, enough that he might attempt to run as a third party candidate, he could potentially pull a large enough percentage of the vote that your beloved Democrat will win.\n\nAs a fiscal conservative, Ron Paul makes me happy.  As someone who is socially liberal Ron Paul worries me a bit.  But at the same time out of all the candidates out there, both on the left and the right, Paul is the only one who really seems to be giving his advice and not avoiding topics with Washingtonspeak.\n\nI am all for you hating any candidate.  I personally hate Guliani and Clinton. I just feel that supporting Ron Paul could be greatly advantageous to what appears to be your cause.\n\n", "author_flair_css_class": null}
