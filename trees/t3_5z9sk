For one thing, almost no one who has the training to do it right wants to have anything to do with it.  (Hippocratic oath and all that.)  For another, due to procedural restrictions, responsibility for the process is broken up among several people so that no one individual is solely responsible for the prisoner's death.  Evidently this has led to a variety of disagreeable situations wherein one or several steps in the process were badly botched.  \n\nIn a nutshell then, I think its the way that lethal injection has been implemented that is at issue, not the actual process itself.

It's been branded too unreliable, too painful and just plain inhumane.\r\n\r\nHmm, the method of lethal injection they describe sounds just like how I put my dog to sleep last year after we decided that fighting cancer any longer would be unfair to him. \r\n\r\nIt certainly looked peaceful and painless.  At the first injection he went quickly to sleep and at the second injection his heart stopped within 5 seconds.  I was holding him in my arms as this happened.  I can assure you that it was quick and painless - for him anyway.\r\n\r\nSo I'm skeptical that while we are able to peacefully and painlessly euthanize an animal at the same time someone suggests lethal injection for humans is painful and violates the convicted criminal's rights by inflicting cruel and unusual punishment on them.\r\n", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5z9sk", "id": "c02br3k", "author_flair_css_class": null}
