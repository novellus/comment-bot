The aesthetics are nice, but nothing I can't do with my linux computer.\n\nThe force-fed file formats are more than frustrating (I don't want WMA-Lossless I want FLAC-why do I have to fight to get FLAC working?). The WGA threat is huge. I never know if I'm going to swap out some hardware (which I do frequently) and find my computer won't boot any more.\n\nThe worse part about it is the overhead. I built my HTPC about 2 years ago and it was a pretty powerful machine. Athlon 64 3200 processor, 4x SATA drives, 1gb memory, a Geforce 6600GT video card. Unfortunately, the system is really slow with this hardware. It definitely needs more RAM and I can't even watch HDTV. It worked fine with XP, no stutters at all, I could even watch HDTV while doing other things on the computer. On Vista, the HDTV is completely unplayable. It's unimaginable how Vista is supposed to be for everyone when you need a gamers card just to watch TV.\n\nOther than that, I actually like it. The audio is a vast improvement (not quite bit perfect but no kmixer). If you've bought some expensive speakers and equipment you'll notice the improvement. The Media Center is also a vast improvement. It's just too bloated and oppressive. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.\n\nThat being said, I'm actually going to stick with it for a bit. I'm upgrading to a Geforce 8600GT card so I can hopefully watch HDTV. I'll see how it goes. I'm much happier with using my Linux computer's though. They just do what I want, how I want it done. And they look just as pretty as Vista despite having about 1/10 of the processing power. The media center interface is superior on Vista compared to Mythtv but I won't be surprised if Mythtv mimics some of the functionality eventually.", "author": "aragon127", "created_utc": "1193319808", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c02b8o5", "parent_id": "t3_5z29q", "id": "c02b8o5", "author_flair_css_class": null}
