What principles would Conservatives would use to determine where and when to regulate?\r\n\r\nCommon Sense/Wisdom of Elders.\r\n\r\nHumans have conflicting natures due to having evolved in small groups (about 25 people perhaps) rather than herds or as individuals.  At about 25 people libertarianism and socialism are about equal.  As population increases libertarianism works better, as it decreases socialism works better.  Since we rarely live in groups of 25 we will tend to want more socialism than is appropriate for our actual conditions.  Various societies have tried out different mixes of policies.\r\n\r\nOvertime natural selection gave us traditional societies which worked well enough.  During the enlightenment philosophers took a look and saw that we could inject a lot more liberty without destroying society, so that is what we did.  The new philosophy was called liberalism, which actually equates to the modern day conservatism of Goldwater, Reagan, and Paul.  Once one philosophy emerged from the traditional mix, its opposite had to emerge: socialism.\r\n\r\nHowever that original liberalism was impure.  It piggybacked on the wisdom of the day.  It kept Christianity and other traditions.  This kept it from becoming extreme to the point of unusability.\r\n\r\nOk the terminology is getting tricky here.  I will list the historic, modern, and future names:\r\n\r\nleft: socialism, liberalism, liberalism?\r\n\r\nleft center: conservatism, moderate, moderate?\r\n\r\nright center: liberalism, conservatism, libertarianism (with green as the religion)\r\n\r\nright: anarchism, libertarianism, anarchism?\r\n\r\nThat's my main question.\r\n\r\n&gt;Provocative.

I can see the Republican party breaking apart with 2/3 going to the libertarian party and 1/3 going to the Democrats.

Incentive works better because the frequently destructive unintended consequences of government coercion often undo or mitigate the potential positive advantages of a centralized authoritarian system.\n\nAs the federal government is the [worst polluter in the United States](http://www.adti.net/environment/congressRecord_pryan102800.html), and given that the environmental protection rules it forces on the people do not necessarily apply to the government (http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode42/usc_sec_42_00007418----000-.html), a great deal of environmental good could be done by getting rid of federal government.\n\n[90% of Americans participate in some kind of outdoor recreation](ftp://mngt.waikato.ac.nz/RePEc/wai/econwp/0712.pdf), spending over $54 Billion doing so in 2006 alone, so there is obviously a market incentive for protecting the environment.\n\nMost libertarians see environmental questions as essentially property rights questions.

Because of this, it is kind of hard to envision exactly what would happen to the environment if the U.S. became a free society.  Suffice it to say, though, that there's a large enough set of incentives for free people to be good stewards of their land and large enough set of disincentives for people to avoid destroying other peoples' property.  In a free society, all property would be privately owned by either individuals or voluntary collectives, and property owners would be held liable for harming other peoples' property.  How they would be held liable depends on the [legal and social structures](http://www.mises.org/rothbard/newliberty11.asp) of a given region.\n\nBy avoiding the monopolistic law systems and property ownership inequities present in authoritarian societies, free societies would see innovative and practical solutions to public goods problems, which ultimately would break down into limited and regional property rights problems instead of nationwide disasters waiting to happen.\n\nThere's no magic or utopian solution that can cure all potential social or environmental problems, but because of the power monopolies and scalar control schemes present in the current system, the overall environment is under *greater* risk than it would be in a less centralized society in which control is personal, local, and based on self-ownership and property rights.
