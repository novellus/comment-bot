Lifehack my ass.\n\nFirst, all the advice there is tired old canned advice.  Second, some of it is very very wrong and very counter-productive.\n\nLifehack has good articles once in a rare while.  It is obvious that a person writing the lifehack blog is neither very experienced nor very wise.  You can tell by the very black-n-white 0 or 1, all-or-nothing zealot tone of some of the advice it carries.  In real life there are shades of gray and different personalities which benefit from different advice.  What's good advice for one person is poison for another person.  There is very little universally good advice.  There is no universally good advice with regard to being productive.\n\nAnd finally, being more productive is a very questionable goal.  Is your life measured by output?  Does a very productive robot have a more meaningful life than a person?\n\nIs the focus on more and more and more **AND MORE CRAP** really a good focus in life?\n\nInstead of telling me how to do more, help me question if doing more is the smart thing to do.  But I can't ask lifehack for that help, since it is obvious the person who runs it is a moron zealot.\n", "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": "1193199088", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5yze7", "id": "c02az1z", "author_flair_css_class": null}
