In fact these things are unreliable and insecure. Cell phones have many known security vulnerabilities, saved from exploitation only because there isn't much point. My TiVo crashes. My MP3 player crashes, and fails to handle certain MP3s. My cell phone hasn't crashed on me yet, but has gotten into some funky states.\n\nThe only thing that's reliable is my TV, so far, and it's utterly basic by modern standards.\n\nIt's easy to secure something that isn't being attacked.
