You spend time trying to get a small part of a page to work when you would be better turfing it and starting from scratch.\n\nMy tips:\n\n* Choose colours beforehand. Take two or three base colours that go together well and use them throughout your site.\n\n* Use one or two fonts only. Stick with a common font size. Don't overuse bold, italics etc.\n\n* Use lots of white space. You might be tempted to remove the margins from your headers and forms (a lot of CSS templates do this) - instead leave the margins.\n\n* Generally I build a site in plain HTML first. I then set up the layout CSS so everything is placed in its general position. Being pixel perfect is not important. Just get things close enough. I try and have a site that looks fine in plain ol' Times New Roman before I start adding colours, fonts, etc.\n\n* Keep it simple. White backgrounds, dark text, etc. If you find that you're not liking the look of something then cut it down to the basics. If you've got a form then reduce it to just the labels and fields and build it up from there. If you're putting boxes around all your content then remove the boxes (try just use them for important content).\n\n* You can't polish a turd. Only focus on the details once you're happy with the overall look.\n\n* Good design isn't easy. However, once you have a design you're happy with you can use the same basics over and over again.

But, if you're interested in design and want to learn more and do it yourself, here's a tip that helps me... \n\nWhen starting a project, first work out the hierarchy/site structure (keep it simple). Then, keeping your project in mind, surf &amp; bookmark. Not to steal ideas, but to get inspiration. Get programming out of your head and look at each page more like it was a piece of art. Don't think about how you're going to put it together, just get general feelings. Find out what you like about a design, what you hate about it. They don't need to be competing sites and can be completely unrelated. Just get ideas and move on. Bookmark 10-20 of them (or as many as you want), then take a break. Come back the next day and weed through them. Again, don't steal ideas, but rather use this as a technique to get inspiration to design. You wont be looking at these sites when you design, but they'll put you in the right frame of mind, and help you define what you want, which is important. Very important.\n\nWhen I first started designing web sites, my designs would go from weak to good to bad, mainly because I didn't know what I wanted in the first place.  I'd just open photoshop and try to design on-the-fly. A tweak here another here... then I'd end up making a change that would completely change the site (say the color scheme) and I'd be stuck not knowing what was better or which direction to go. Get an idea in your head first -- it'll save you from \"designing until you like it\" syndrome.\n\nI also agree with harsman, get \"The Non-Designer's Design Book\" -- it's worth it. It's a simple read and covers a lot of common pitfalls in graphic design. Some sections might take a few reads before they start to gel, but there's not a lot of extraneous fluff.\n\nHere's a good site for inspiration...\n\n[http://www.designinteract.com/sow/](http://www.designinteract.com/sow/)\n\nDon't miss the \"previous sites\" or the \"SOW Archives\" in the sidebar", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "programming", "name": "t1_c02ba41", "parent_id": "t3_5z2qm", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}
