Perhaps they should generalise and workout a way to take full advantage of the advancing technical trends, rather than trying to hold them back.\n\nIn the long term, it's just about embracing what they have available to them. It's a frequently recurring issue that out-dated, out-moded industries die-off when they don't adapt quickly enough. The unfortunate side-effect being that until they're dead they drag the \"adapted\" industry down with them.\n\nI guarantee the profile of the music industry won't look much different for about 10 more years... this is how longs it's gonna take them to play catch-up.\n\np.s.

TvLinks operated underneath the idea that Downloading videos was WRONG, but providing links to streaming FLVs wasn't a problem. Allowing the use of the Veoh player gave everyone an instant \"download to your PC\" link, which is why it wasn't used. Also, the Veoh link that was used on tvlinks had the videoid in it, which would allow any sort of organizaion interested in finding the video URL a direct link.\n\nGoogle video links were NEVER linked directly to the FLV. They used their player nearly every time, due to the differences in regional google video IDs.\n\nYoutube links also used their player. Another false point. Same with tudou and youku (most of the time), and nearly every other host. Veoh was just the main problem.\n\nAlso, implying that people uploaded videos JUST for tvlinks isn't a view that could easily be supported. I've seen no proof of this. Most videos found on video host sites have blatant titles and video desctiptions telling the viewer what they're watching. Ever search myspace videos for those popular mid-90's cartoons? Yea, they're all there in full, and usually in triplicate.\n\nAlsoalso, using something like URLSnooper or TamperData could EASILY find the video location for the person to report.
