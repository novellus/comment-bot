Even with the tiny amount of press he has received in the traditional media, by using the internet, he has forced his way into, at very least, being viewed as a threat to entrenched power structures. The power of the internet as a tool for political organization lies in its ability to provide an avenue for each and every individual to reach a mass audience in an unprecedented way.  Broadcasting of opinion, be it through publishing, radio, or television is no longer only available to the very wealthy.  That is what gives the internet the potential to truly transform and actually democratize politics, much more so than TV or radio.  However, it is far from a foregone conclusion that the internet will revolutionize politics. As we already see the internet having some degree of influence on the current political climate, those in power will seek to control the parameters of acceptable speech and debate online.  Powerful interests have already realized the transformative power of the internet and are working to gain control over it. Often this is done through co-opting the process, (eg. Murdoch buying MySpace), rather than ignoring or resisting it.  Yes, the establishment is scared of the internet.  I know I would be if I were a crooked politician or CEO.  This is also why it's so important to support net neutrality, but that's a whole different thread.
