I'm not necessarily advocating doing it in Java as a good solution, but it's not a terrible one. (I'd probably recommend using Scala or similar instead of actually using Java, but you run into generics issues)\n\nYou can take a look at [JGraph](http://www.jgraph.com/jgraph.html). The basic components are LGPL but if you want to use the full blown thing it becomes GPL. If this isn't a problem for you it might well be worthwhile. I've not used it, but it seems decent.\n\nI've been using [JUNG](http://jung.sourceforge.net/). It's reasonably easy to get something up and running quickly with it. My experience at pushing it to more advanced things has not been especially positive. \n\nIf you're willing to go commercial, [yFiles](http://www.jgraph.com/jgraph.html) is pretty featureful. \n\nOr you could roll your own. It's not like basic graph editing is hard. Use something like [JGraphT](http://www.jgraph.com/jgraph.html) for the back end representation if you need to do complicated graph algorithms. For the front end, try using [picollo](http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/jazz/). It comes with a graph editor example which is really easy to make work and extend and allows for some rather slick interactivity. It doesn't scale very well if you want to visualise thousands of nodes (figuring out how to make it do so is on my to do list), but works pretty well for a few hundred. \n\nActually, that's a general point with all these Java solutions. They generally work well for a few thousand nodes and then swing starts making sad faces at you when you try to visualise large graphs. I'm pretty sure this isn't an inherent limitation so much as the results of people really being interested in the small graph case.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2fwo", "name": "t1_c02c680", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "ups": 2, "link_id": "t3_5zg25", "retrieved_on": 1427424979, "id": "c02c680", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5zg25", "body": "What's *really* easy?
