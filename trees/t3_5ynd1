But no, you blinked, and not only made the terrorists happy, but you made a whole new generation of terrorists, created about 50 new corrupt billionaires, gave away your civil rights, ruined the checks and balances by ripping up the constitution, gave control of your economy to the Chinese and all it cost was the lives of 3500 American soldiers and about a million Iraqis.\n\nTime to try the same trick with Iran I guess.
