Try entering a phrase from a particular skit like \"Jeff Gannon\". Get nothing.\n\nTry it on Google [\"Daily Show video Jeff Gannon\"](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=com.ubuntu:en-US:official&amp;hs=oo3&amp;q=Daily+Show+video+jeff+gannon&amp;btnG=Search)\n\n[Result #2 is a page with the whole segment on it](http://blogumentary.typepad.com/chuck/2005/02/video_daily_sho.html). If you're not better than Google at finding your own content then you suck.\n\nReddit admits this.\n\n* Even after joining I cannot vote or comment on any of the video clips.\nWhat's the point of these features if you can't use them?\n\n* Registration process required an email confirmation which then took me to a page where I got a 128-bit GUID in a text box with a button next to it. Which I then had to press? What was that about? Someone's lame ass and obviously very broken cookie system?\n\n* There is no way to browse video clips in general. You can either look at most recent or those accessible by tag. You can't browse by date, subject anything. To find a clip you have to know when it was aired approximately and then figure out what \"tag\" it would have been filed under and then page through the list of videos until you get there. This is totally horrible.\n\n* Tags are nearly useless. The tags should reflect the content of the skit. Yeah it's nice to see the names of the Daily Show characters in the skit, but what we remember are the jokes, the content, the people who were referenced in the funny segments: the targets, the foils. And how could you do a series of tags with out segment titles such as Messopotamia, etc!!\n\n* Video clips are arbitrarily broken up. So the above Jeff Gannon Segment is broken up into 3 individual clips for some reason. \n\nThe first part entitled [Headlines - Blog Cabin Republican](http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=120914&amp;title=headlines-blog-cabin-republican) actually begins with the show intro and a 90 second segment about the NHL players strike, which is totally unrelated to the subject of the segment! The Intro should be a completely separate clip, or the link to the segment should take us to the time offset into the video stream of the show where the segment actually begins.\n\nThe second part entitled [Plague of Bloggers](http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=120995&amp;title=plague-of-bloggers) consists of the 82 second middle of what was one coherent segment on Gannon. By separating it out the focus becomes Eason Jordon, which totally changes the nuance of this skit. As part of the larger segment it showed the ineffectiveness of the media. As it's own thing it elevates the value of the Eason Jordon outing beyond it's actual significance. The point of this part of the segment was to contrast how the real blogs found a real scandal in the Gannon incident, with how the media and right wing machine drummed out Eason Jordon for almost no reason. The whole chain of events clarified how a rumor is created on the right, amplified through it's print machine until it is laundered into a mainstream newspaper, and then followed up and \"justified\" by the ridiculous right wing TV pundit machine. This is a key revelation of the right wing propaganda system, and still is a revolutionary moment in television. Without the context of the first part and the third, we totally lose the relevance of this sequence.\n\nThe third part entitled [Bloggers](http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=121081&amp;title=bloggers) of course is the Colbert segment, which really both legitimized blogs in the news business, particularly Atrios, and also created the character that would later become the focus of the Colbert Report.\n\nAs a unified piece this segment was historic in putting the Daily Show itself on the map, as both a significant news source of unreported news and as a source of analysis of how that news was or was not reported, not to mention creating the seed for the Colbert Report, all the while legitimizing the blogsphere as a news reporting service!\n\nHugely important stuff.\n\nHowever none of this meaning can be seen or understood from the Daily Show site. There is no way the community can even begin to add this knowledge to the site.  It's practically impossible to even navigate to these clips, which is atrocious.\n\nSearch should be based on the transcipts of each show, which should be at the minimum matched up to their containing video clips, if not the location within these clips. Also the clips from the show should be able to be viewed within the chronology of the show they were broadcast in. Why can't I click on 2/15/05 and see all the skits from that show on one page.\n\nTags should be user created based on content. James Guckert, Ted Hitler, Jeff Gannon, Eason Jordon should all immediately go to this show, and any other show they were mentioned on.\n\nThe current site is just a repackaging of the last attempt. The only good thing about it is that all the Stewart Era clips are online. They're impossible to get to, organize, comment on, or add any value to, but they are there.\n\n**Note to Daily Show/Viacom**: If you want us to watch the ads you are going to have to make your websites the most convenient method  for accessing and using parts of your shows. If you don't provide this best information product other people will just build it around you, foreclosing your potential ad revenue stream.\n\nBetter yet, hire someone like me to show you how to do this correctly.\n\nCase in point. This clip motivated me to create a youtube account, in order to highlight it's historical importance. It got over 50,000 views on youtube and 20 something awards. Of course I also announced the youtube location of the videos on reddit. Unsurprisingly during the process of pursuing the Viacom/Youtube lawsuit you had the clip pulled along with many many others; so now it gets no views there.\n\nDespite having set up this crude web based video playing system into which you can inject your ads, you still have not provided a method of access as simple or as easy to use as youtube, by which the users may add extra meaning and significance to your content to give it life beyond its broadcast. Any chance you guys will get serious about this soon? It's been what, almost 2 years.
