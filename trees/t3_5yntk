This generation is also the first in which I've bought a new console, and I jumped to get a PS3 with the Emotion Engine hardware backwards-compatibility as soon as I heard that it would be discontinued in the future. The back-catalogue of PS2 games is *massive*, and there's a very large selection of games which have garnered 8/10 &amp; 9/10 reviews. If you dismiss those simply because they don't have \"next-gen\" graphics then fine, but you're really missing out. Gameplay is what's important, and I'm sure you'll come to realise this. So far my PS3 has spent more time playing PS2 games than it has playing Motorstorm &amp; Resistance.\n\nStroller.
