When I first moved here I was frequently hungry because there was so 'little' food.\n\n2. French meals often have a lot of variety made up of small portions. Small starter, small plate, small dessert.  Hence you end up eating lots of different stuff, some of which is sugary and fatty, but that's only a small part.\n\n3. Public transportation plus walking a lot means that you do lots of 'accidental' exercise.  My cholesterol dropped to a normal level (after having been a little high) within six months of being in France.  I did _nothing_ to change my lifestyle or diet.  I just lived the way the French do.  I also lost about 10 pounds returning me to 'normal' weight for my height.\n\n4. Smoking and coffee.  Cigarettes and small strong coffees are ubiquitous.  Both cut appetite.  I don't smoke, but I do drink those small coffees.\n\n5. Eating between meals is looked down on.  Snacking seems strange to the French.\n\n6. Family meals are very common, and food is often bought in markets.

The invert sugar or dextrose is there to preserve the potassium iodide.  It's only .04% (which would be .004 of the product).  So that would explain why it doesn't brown, preserve, etc.  And it sure as heck isn't like so many people are saying, as if there's 20% sugar in our salt or something.\n\nAnd if that's what it's there for, then it's in ALL iodized salt, not just evil American salt.\n\nWhat is .04% of a pound, anyway?  .064 ounce?
