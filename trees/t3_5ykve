If I had PS2 games, I would've had a PS2. \n\nOf course it'll be more expensive than a Wii: it has the next generation of media format. If XBOX 360 or the Wii had an HD-DVD reader come with the system, they both would probably cost at least 150 more.\n\nThat said, I'm leaning towards an XBOX 360 because I like to play sports games, and EA Sports pretty much screwed PS3 owners with some lackluster performances. 30 FPS on Madden and NHL on PS3 while they get 60 FPS on XBOX 360 is pretty ridiculous.
