Anyway, so he is saying that the federal government should have any say whatsoever in these matters.  Yes, that would mean that some states would go batshit crazy.  I live in Texas and the majority of people here have forgotten any kickass 'live-free-or-die' 'remember the alamo' roots, and they would likely turn this otherwise great state into a scary place to live.  On the other hand however it would get the federal government off of the backs of californians who want to legalize medical pot, it would allow the freak libertarians to run to new hampshire and smoke crack and pay people 2 dollars per hour to be bouncers at whore houses.

Given the level of disagreement in the country, and even talk of secession, states rights and smaller federal government do make sense.  One can look at it as a modest kind of disunion - a loosening of the bonds that tie disagreeing parties together.\r\n\r\nThe progressive reaction (my reaction) to the right wing noises Paul makes (low taxes, states rights, religion) is due to the cynical way in which Republicans have exploited these issues (and others like patriotism, family, etc) to pursue a radical corporatist, authoritarian agenda.  So the whole heap of right wing ideas smells a little badly at this point.\r\n\r\nTaking Paul's policies in their totality, however, does indeed seem to point at a different vision: unyoking the states from each other, each to pursue its own ways.  A weaker Federal government, lower *Federal* taxes, lower military spending, abolishment of the CIA, lower federal social programs.  If his policy is to devolve these functions to the states (rather than religion), it would sound attractive to progressives, I think.  I'm sure there are many blue staters who would be happy to let the red states go (and pay) their own way: in a sense to allow each state to compete in the market of opportunity.  Red staters can bloviate all they want about the coasts, but they'll be eating economic dust if that's what it comes down to.  I'm sure progressives would be quite happy to place their bets on their home turf.   \r\n\r\nWhat I would like to know is -- what are RP's ideas about corporations?

Taking away Federal power without addressing this other issue seems a recipe for a new kind of disaster ([which seems already underway](http://www.amazon.com/Shock-Doctrine-Rise-Disaster-Capitalism/dp/0805079831 )).
