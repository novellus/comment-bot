If you're not here for a dialogue, stay out of the comments.\n\nAsked previously: For 13 years now we've had no net neutrality laws whatsoever... and largely it's been a neutral network. What changed 2 years ago that suddenly we need this?\n\nMore importantly, even if we do, how could you ever trust the FCC to police it? These are the guys that are fervently trying to get rid of the rules that keep 3 mega-corps from owning all of the tv, radio, movie, newspaper, and web news sites in the nation.\n\nYou've never answered this.\n\n&gt; And he is against Universal Health-Care..\n\nOr maybe he's against something that all the big HMOs are for? They've had hardons for SCHIP for a long while now, apparently. As a medical doctor, I'm going to assume that Paul knows more about this than you.\n\n&gt; Further, Paul is anti-abortion rights and anti-gay rights (or says \"let states decide\" which is not good enough for human-rights issues)\n\nActually, that's where you're wrong. \"Let the states decide\" is ideal for both of these... instead of outlawing abortion in one place, the pro-lifers would need to do so in 50 places. That won't happen.\n\nAs for gay marriage, if just one state allows it, you go there, you get married, and all states have to honor it. It's called \"full faith and credit\".", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02afnn", "id": "c02ag0r", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "politics", "name": "t1_c02afnn", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "ups": 1, "link_id": "t3_5ysnx", "retrieved_on": 1427425860, "id": "c02afnn", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02afck", "body": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "politics", "score_hidden": false, "ups": -3, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5ysnx", "retrieved_on": 1427425864, "id": "c02afck", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02afck", "parent_id": "t3_5ysnx", "body": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null}
