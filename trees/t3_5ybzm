I wish you could have paid a little more heed to the real story, however, that Ron Paul came on top.  Mitt Romney is not especially appealing to even his strongest support base, namely those like me who are \"Mormon conservatives\".\n\nRon Paul, on the other hand, is a true conservative--the fiscal and moral conservative that the floundering Republican party needs to revive it from the ashes.  His call for a return to constitutional rule of law is resounding across the nation, and it would serve news gatekeepers well to be among the first to spot the trend.  Ron Paul has taken 1st place in no fewer than 16 straw polls around the nation.\n\nAs another reporter, Denny Jackson, in the StatesmanJournal noted today:\n\n&gt; Oregon Republicans got a wake-up call when their straw poll at the Portland World Trade Center was transformed into a Ron Paul rally, and his supporters crushed the opposition in the poll.\n&gt; About 100 Paul supporters brought signs and banners, waved at traffic and pedestrians for blocks around the center, handed out literature and ended up putting Ron Paul in the winner's seat with 67 percent of the vote. Other candidates couldn't generate enough enthusiasm to get anyone at all to come out with any visible support.\n&gt; Instead of ignoring or opposing Paul's efforts as they have done to date, the Republican Party leadership should be asking themselves what it is about this man that brings so many people out of their comfortable homes and hobbies to volunteer to campaign for him when other politicians are looked upon as something nasty that got on their shoe.\n&gt; Here's a little hint for them: Ron Paul is today's Thomas Jefferson.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nDuane Johnson\nProvo, Utah", "author_flair_css_class": null}
