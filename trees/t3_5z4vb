Why address real issues that no one cares about? I guess that's the problem, we don't care about the people dying in underdeveloped countries. We care about thinking we are better and more important than anyone else, about believing we are more powerful than nature, we care much more about our perceived moral superiority than we do about actual facts, actual science, and actually helping actual people with actual problems.
