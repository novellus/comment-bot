Would you be able to just stop getting upset about that? If not, why?\n\nBecause it is a similar biological urge. Just as you are not able to *not* get upset when your partner (often unconsciously) measures others for sexual partners--he cannot *not* do it. It comes built-in. \n\nAnother classic example is the guy staring at the boobs instead of the face while talking. In the cliche, the female gets upset, she cannot help it. On the other hand, the male cannot help looking.\n\nMonogamy is in many ways admirable and certainly a fine way of raising children. It is something to strive for. At the same time, realistically we must understand that sometimes the body works in its own way. A little bit of looking is probably alright--and so is a bit of jealousy. Honesty is a good policy and those incapable of monogamy should avoid it. ", "author_flair_css_class": null}
