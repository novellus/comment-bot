OK, except that Trentepohlia algae spores have DNA, and traits common to most plants.

Beyond what we've identified to date.\n\nJust because somebody said \"Oh it must be ...\" doesn't make it so.  And that goes for extraterrestrial too.

Incomplete incineration of chemical waste somewhere in the Eloor chemicals manufacture zone fits the available data rather better than any other explanation.\n\nCheck out how local people have been working in Kerala in recent years to get something done about pollution in the Periyar river, and the fire at the endosuplhan plant, and see then if it seems plausible that the red rain was chemical fallout.\n\nBack to the red rain, why is it that none of the reports seem to mention the use of high pressure liquid chromatography to analyse the particles? This is one of the first techniques that would normally be used to identify what's in unknown substances. Lawks a' mercy, the CESS report and Godfrey Louis's 3 papers on arXiv don't even mention determination of the density of the particles.
