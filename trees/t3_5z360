In high school, I decided to publicly declare myself a Christian and live my life accordingly.\n\nIn college, I started thinking differently.  Serious moral questions were brought to light.  I struggled with myself for months about how I felt.  I no longer believed in God, but as a Christian, I also believed in Satan and spiritual warfare.  I told myself that I was doing powerful things in the name of Christ (indeed, I spent two weeks in Mississippi after Hurricane Katrina rebuilding houses - regardless of your creed that is a powerful thing), and as such, Satan would want to hurt my faith.\n\nThis was the most emotionally intense experience I have ever had.  Over a period of about 6 months, I went from an active leader in a church to a full-blown atheist.\n\nThis left me in the same position as the student in the article.  I was an atheist in a community of Christians.  All of my friends, my family, the people I respected - they were all Christians.  It was weeks before I told my best friend.  He was devastated.  We stayed up all night talking about it.  I didn't tell my family for a few months after that.  My sister barely speaks to me anymore.  We used to be so close.  Communicating with my father has become a battle of wills.  We can barely have a conversation without him trying to persuade me to come back to church with him.\n\nMost of my friends know by now.  It's been a little over a year.  I like to tell myself that things are the same between us, but I know they aren't.  None of the girls I knew would even consider dating me, because the Bible warns against Christians dating non-believers.  My guy friends still try to include me in things, but its easy to feel excluded when all your best friends are at a Bible-study together and you're alone in your room.\n\nBut despite all the hardship this decision has brought me, if I were able to go back 14 months from now and talk to the emotionally and spiritually wrecked boy that I used to be, I would tell him that he was making the right choice.  I would not trade what I have now for what I had then in a million years.  I have honesty know.  I have accountability.  I have self-worth and pride.  I am more mature, more articulate, and more confident.\n\nMy advice to the student in the article is this:  Life is too short to spend it miserable.  If you have to lie in order to make your community accept you, then you are in the wrong community.  If your friends reject you, then you will find new friends.  If your family rejects you, it is their own fault - not yours.\n\nIn my own experience, it is best to be honest about who you are and what you believe, regardless of the consequences.", "author": "Bobwise", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c02b8yg", "parent_id": "t3_5z360", "id": "c02b8yg", "author_flair_css_class": null}
