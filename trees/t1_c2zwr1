Are you against their existence?  Their frame of mind?  Their opinion?  Why not simply disagree with their ideas rather than be \"*against them*?\"\n\nAnother interesting thing to consider is that humanity has already been around the planet with temperatures near where they are now; (Medievil Warm Period.)  Yet surprisingly, the human race wasn't wiped off the face of the planet due to the melting permafrost in the Northern Atlantic.\n\nIn fact, the Vikings used the ice-free ocean to explore and colonize Greenland.\n\n&gt;It's time to move beyond this skepticism bullshit.\n\nThis runs contrary to your previous statement:\n&gt;Change in itself is not at all evil, but what is dangerous for our own survival is that, as you say, we have *no idea* what will happen when this change does occur.\n\nYou're right, *you don't have any idea.*  So until you can conclusively prove the supposition you are implying, namely *the current warming of the Earth is dangerous to our survival as a species*, then skepticism is not only **not** \"bullshit,\" but also completely necessary in the scientific process, which based on your previous comments seems to be something you are trying to extoll to make your case.\n\n&gt;Notice how that argument almost always comes hand in hand with an ad-hominem attack of the sort \"he's trying to get attention\".\n\nHow darling.
