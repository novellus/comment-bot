Or, if they just became good because they did so much public speaking.   Look at the leaders of the world then: \n\nFDR, Churchill, Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin were all very accomplished public speakers. But then, politics of the time was centered around Public Speaking events.  \n\nToday, the candidates from any of the Democratic Powers can't really speak very well...  Even those current leaders we think of as pretty good speakers, like Clinton or Blair, really don't even measure up to Eisenhower or Clement Attlee... who were not considered very good speakers in their day.  \n\nWhen it comes to Bush... Some want to say that he used to be a lot better at speaking, so the current ineptness has to be an act.  I don't really think that is true as much.  I think it is because Bush used to have to speak regularly with those who disagreed with him about some issues.  Now, the President doesn't have anybody in his Administration who regularly disagrees with him.  He also doesn't appear to seek out people who disagree with him in order to hear the opposing viewpoint.  So, his speaking ability... His ability to think on his feet, as it were, as atrophied. \n\nSay what you want about Clinton, but he regularly listened to opposing viewpoints.  \nEven Nixon wanted to hear opposing viewpoints.   There was a story about Hubert Humphrey when he was in the hospital.  He had told the Hospital Staff he didn't want to take phone calls from admirers wishing him well, and to only let through calls from his direct family members.  Late at night, phone rings.... and the Former VP is thinking \"this can't be good if my wife is calling now\"... and it was President Nixon looking for advice about something.   Nixon wanted to talk about all 14+ different sides of an issue before he made a final decision.  Even if he ended up going with the original thinking on the issue.  \n\nNow, can you even imagine Bush calling up Gore or Kerry to talk with him about anything in politics?  Bush never considers that he might be wrong about anything, and would never deem to find out the viewpoint from those across the eisle on any issue.
