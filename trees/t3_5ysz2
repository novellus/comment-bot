You're going to have to do better than link to organizations whose livelihood depends on more money going to the homeless.  We already give them some money.  Doesn't this reveal America's good 'character', since what they have really earned for themselves of that amount is $0?\n\n2: \"The money could be much better spent if those involved were actually interested in resolving the issue. That's my main point.\"  Who is 'those involved'?  The residents?  The homeless?  Dispassionate observers like you and me?  I am guessing you mean the residents, in which case that's my main point: the money was well-spent, because they raised the money to achieve a specific outcome and achieved that outcome.  But that's where we run into another unclear point: What is the issue?  The problem of homelessness?  Or the beauty of the residents' neighborhood?\n\n3: \"We have a group of people that agree that homelessness is a problem.\"  No we don't.  We have a group of people that agree that homelessness in their neighborhood is a problem.  big difference.\n\nAlso, they didn't raise $15k to help the homeless, they raised it to move the homeless out.  So the choice is not between $15k to move the homeless out versus $15k to help the homeless (unless you are advocating seizing their money and deciding what happens with it), it is investing 15k to move the homeless out (to an equivalently good place, we assume) versus nothing done.  What is immoral about raising $15k to make my neighborhood prettier (if the homeless move somewhere equally good), and how is it different from spending $15k on planting flowers?\n\nSo what you are technically saying is that these neighborhood residents should provide additional assistance to the homeless instead of doing nothing, in other words they are OBLIGATED to do so (hence, you want to decide what happens to others' money).  But I don't think this is what you truly mean, I am just poking holes in your logic/syntax, so let me try again.  What I think you MEAN is:\n\nThese neighborhood residents should provide additional assistance to the homeless instead of beautifying their neighborhood, and doing otherwise is \"immoral, [because] They aren't helping anyone but themselves. They are valuing their property over the wellbeing of their countrymen.\"  Do you always think this is true?  Might you ever buy shutters for your house, or are you going to give the money to the homeless instead?\n\nI'll spare you the reply and assume you will buy yourself the shutters.
