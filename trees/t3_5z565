(Be Advised of online tracking vs. on Computer tracking, I recommend if you make $ on the side, to keep your financial info separate from your online banking info).\n\nSet 10% of your gross income (for both Cash and Bank Deposits) into two separate accounts (this way you can transfer $ between accounts by spending your cash capitol and remembering to add to your bank capitol, without actually having to deposit anything, wow, the fed's don't want you to know that one).\n\nThen, when you hit broke.\n\nSpend your savings, just remember to pay your capitol lost (your 10% savings overall) back next paycheck including your 10% of balance at time of deposit.\n\nEx. Sudden Car Repair (Rainy Day scenario), spend that capitol to get yourself back onto your revenue generating feet, but keep track of how much you spent and spread it out across your paychecks to re-establish your savings baseline of 10% of gross income.\n\nEx. Car repair = 300, savings is only 500, therefore, spend 300 on repairs, keep track of paychecks and add 10% + 100 each paycheck until you recover the 300 lost from capitol.\n\nSecond,\n\nEvery paycheck, put in 10% of your Balance (not actual paycheck, but running balance at the time). THIS WAY YOU HAVE AN ACCRUING %.\n\nTo transfer money between accounts, use your saved Cash (capitol) to buy gas or food. Just keep track of how much your losing from your capitol so next time you get paid, you put more money into your Bank account savings.\n\nWorks quite well.\n\nYou never feel like you're tied to your income because your living under 90% of it.\n\nOf course, if your bills are so extensive that it's impossible to live within 90% of your income, this may not work.\n\nThat's where the financial software helps.\n\nOf course you can change the factor of 10% to anything you wish, it's just based upon what you reasonably can save and your desire for spending power.", "author": "Thistleknot", "created_utc": "1193361913", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "archived": true, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5z565", "id": "c02bdzz", "author_flair_css_class": null}
