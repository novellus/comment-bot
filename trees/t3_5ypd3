If you happen to be thinking about getting into Network Marketing then this may be helpful for you. There are things to look for in a Network Marketing business that will keep you from just spinning your wheels and getting nowhere. It is true that most Network Marketing businesses fail. That is what happens to most any business in their first five years. But if you know how to do it right, then Network Marketing is the best career in the world! \r\n\r\nYou should be able to start with little cost. Avoid big sign-up fees and expensive frontloading where you have to spend thousands of dollars to get started, buying your way to the top of a pay plan, having to purchase large volumes to qualify for your check, and having to stock inventory yourself. Run away from anybody requiring you to do those things. \r\n\r\nDo not fall for outrageous claims such as making money with no selling. In Network Marketing you can get people placed under you without having to do anything if the people above you are doing a lot of work and your compensation plan is a forced matrix or power leg binary. That kind of thing is called spillover, but you cannot count on getting rich from that. People joining with that expectation will be disappointed. Even worse, do not get involved with a company that is offering a business opportunity but has no product or service to sell other than the opportunity. Always, before you join any company, go to the Internet search engines and check for complaints and scam warnings. \r\n\r\nSales and distribution are the backbone of all business. Direct sales are the type we are more familiar with. The products of a company are peddled by a salesperson that receives a commission, which is a percentage of the money gained by the sale. That is the traditional sales approach. The salesperson can also be paid on an hourly or salaried basis, even per lead contacted as long as they meet a sales quota, but the source of income for business is always sales driven. \r\n\r\nHaving found those things, you then present the business opportunity and the product to as many people as possible. Your warm market is people you know, such as friends, family, and co-workers. Beyond that, you can advertise, or buy lead lists of people interested in starting a business or interested in your type of product or service. \r\n\r\nFor Network Marketing the most targeted list you can get are MLM Genealogy Lists. Those are people who have showed an interest in Network Marketing by already having been involved in it. Do an Internet search for MLM Genealogy Lists if you want to buy one. Those lists are not expensive and many of the people on it already have experience building a business. Those are the people you want on your team! \r\n\r\nfor more info and tips log onto\r\nwww.freeyourjob.info", "author_flair_css_class": null}
