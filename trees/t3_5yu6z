First of all, libertarianism does not necessarily imply ethical egoism (which says that altruism is wrong). Libertarians don\u2019t care what another party does with its resources as long as it doesn\u2019t \u201cdeprive another party of life, liberty or property through force or fraud\u201d. Hence, the government is free to provide any set of benevolent public services (after fulfilling its duty). It is not free to use force or fraud to transfer resources from one party to another however. So while some taxes are morally wrong, revenue acquired through legitimate taxes belong completely to the government and can be spent however it wishes (again, after fulfillment of its basic duties).\n\nI won\u2019t bother to risk the appearance of creating a straw man argument by suggesting that the parent believes that most people in a libertarian society would be psychopaths (though that is what was implied).

This seems to be particularly regrettable because of the consequent tendency of many true liberals to describe themselves as conservatives.\n\n&gt; It is true, of course, that in the struggle against the believers in the all-powerful state the true liberal must sometimes make common cause with the conservative, and in some circumstances, as in contemporary Britain [1956], he has hardly any other way of actively working for his ideals.  But true liberalism is still distinct from conservatism, and there is danger in the two being confused.\n\n&gt; Conservatism, though a necessary element in any stable society, is not a social program; in its paternalistic, nationalistic, and power-adoring tendencies it is often closer to socialism than true liberalism: and with its traditionalistic, anti-intellectual, and often mystical propensities it will never, except in short periods of disillusionment, appeal to the young and all those others who believe that some changes are desirable if this world is to become a better place.\n\n&gt; A conservative movement, by its very nature, is bound to be a defender of established privilege and to lean on the power of government for the protection of privilege.  The essence of the liberal position, however, is the denial of all privilege, if privilege is understood in its proper and original meaning of the state granting and protecting rights to some which are not available on equal terms to others.\"\n\nApparently you guys have forgotten to drink your own kool-aid.
