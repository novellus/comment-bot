You should read the links you post before making them. Photoelectric effect did not give rise to transistors or IC. \n\nUses and effects\n\n[edit] Photodiodes and phototransistors\n\nSolar cells (used in solar power) and light-sensitive diodes use a variant of the photoelectric effect, but not ejecting electrons out of the material. In semiconductors, light of even relatively low energy, such as visible photons, can kick electrons out of the valence band and into the higher-energy conduction band, where they can be harnessed, creating electric current at a voltage related to the bandgap energy.\n\n[edit] Image sensors\n\nVideo camera tubes in the early days of television used the photoelectric effect; newer variants used photoconductive rather than photoemissive materials.\n\nSilicon image sensors, such as charge-coupled devices, widely used for photographic imaging, are based on a variant of the photoelectric effect, in which photons knock electrons out of the valence band of energy states in a semiconductor, but not out of the solid itself.\n\n[edit] Electroscopes\n\nElectroscopes are fork-shaped, hinged metallic leaves placed in a vacuum jar, partially exposed to the outside environment. When an electroscope is charged positively or negatively, the two leaves separate, as charge distributes evenly along the leaves causing repulsion between two like poles. When ultraviolet radiation (or any radiation above threshold frequency) shines onto the metallic outside of the electroscope, a negatively charged scope will discharge and the leaves will collapse, while nothing will happen to a positively charged scope (besides charge decay). The reason is that electrons will be liberated from the negatively charged one, gradually making it neutral, while liberating electrons from the positively charged one will make it even more positive, keeping the leaves apart\n\n[edit] Photoelectron spectroscopy\n\nSince the energy of the photoelectrons emitted is exactly the energy of the incident photon minus the material's work function or binding energy, the work function of a sample can be determined by bombarding it with a monochromatic X-ray source or UV source (typically a helium discharge lamp), and measuring the kinetic energy distribution of the electrons emitted.\n\nUsing lasers, different photon energies are available. This method allows looking into the bulk, or into nanostructures on the top, or with 50 eV at the topmost atomic layer. Laser pulses can be used for time-resolved two-photon PES to monitor dynamics. They also allow the use of time-of-flight spectrometers for 10 eV ranges, using fewer electrons.\n\nPhotoelectron spectroscopy is done in a high vacuum environment, since the electrons would be scattered by air.\n\nA typical electron energy analyzer is a concentric hemispherical analyser (CHA), which uses an electric field to divert electrons different amounts depending on their kinetic energies. For every element and core atomic orbital there will be a different binding energy. The many electrons created from each will then show up as spikes in the analyzer, and can be used to determine the elemental composition of the sample.[8]\n\n[edit] Spacecraft\n\nThe photoelectric effect will cause spacecraft exposed to sunlight to develop a positive charge. This can get up to the tens of volts. This can be a major problem, as other parts of the spacecraft in shadow develop a negative charge (up to several kilovolts) from nearby plasma, and the imbalance can discharge through delicate electrical components. The static charge created by the photoelectric effect is self-limiting, though, because a more highly-charged object gives up its electrons less easily.[9]\n\n[edit] Moon dust\n\nLight from the sun hitting lunar dust causes it to become charged through the photoelectric effect. The charged dust then repels itself and lifts off the surface of the Moon by electrostatic levitation. This manifests itself almost like an \"atmosphere of dust\", visible as a thin haze and blurring of distant features, and visible as a dim glow after the sun has set. This was first photographed by the Surveyor program probes in the 1960s. It is thought that the smallest particles are repelled up to kilometers high, and that the particles move in \"fountains\" as they charge and discharge.[10][11]", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"subreddit": "reddit.com", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 0, "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": "1192565214", "children": [{"subreddit": "reddit.com", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 0, "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": "1192595551", "children": [{"controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1427426222, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "archived": true, "name": "t1_c029nti", "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5ybbm", "downs": 0, "score": 0, "score_hidden": false, "body": "It's all over wikipedia.
