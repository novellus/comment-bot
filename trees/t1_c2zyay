Say what you want, but before World War 2 eight recessions in the United States worsened into depressions (1807, 1837, 1873, 1882, 1893, 1920, 1933, and 1937). Since World War 2, after which we started employing Keynesian monetary policies, there have been ten recessions (1945-46, 1949, 1954, 1956, 1960-61, 1970, 1973-75, 1980-83, 1990-92, 1997, 2001) and no depressions.\n\nYou ever think that maybe it might be the effect of all of Mugabe's other crackpot policies that is ruining his country?
