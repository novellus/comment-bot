They've taken slanted, sensationalist reporting and made it into an art form.  They're also the most likely to take Republican talking points and run with them.  The other networks are aghast that Fox has stolen so much of their ratings, so they've been trying to play catch-up ever since.\r\n\r\nThings like that make me get the news from multiple Internet sources and ignore the major media outlets.  We know Fox News reserves the right to make up or falsify news as they see fit because they used it (successfully, to my astonishment) as a defense in court.  They are a \"news entertainment\" company, so they tell the news in such a way that they feel will entertain their audience.
