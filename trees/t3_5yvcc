Rape, though a worthwhile demand cause to go after, is quite small. I think I've read something like 300,000 a year (though this would only be reported, hard to guage those unreported). Something like 1 in 12 might result in pregnancy. That's 25,000. How many end up abortion though, half? Three quarters?\n\nIt's significant (in my opinion) but feeble compared to the other initiatives. I think directly or indirectly, poverty must account for close to two thirds of abortion. Easy. Sure, there will always be dumb teenagers getting pregnant, and women from all income ranges get raped, or discover that they're pregnant when it would cause too many problems in their lives... but I think if poverty were reduced in real ways, it would affect the majority of abortions we see now.\n\nAgain, just intuition, and I won't be shocked if someone shows me numbers that are different. But for other social problems, like crime in general, poverty figures into it in a big way.\n\n&gt; This I think is the logical conclusion from your own analogy.\n\nIt's getting late, and one of us is confused.

You're not erasing old wounds by opening everything wide up.\n\nI can only imagine from your original framework of the analogy that this one group is prevented from abortion and the other two groups are granted all the benefits you mentioned (education, access and good jobs).\n\nThis I think is the logical conclusion from your own analogy.

Maybe by rights, abortion should be illegal.\n\nBut that won't ever happen, and if by some dark miracle it does, for someone like me who's concerned with the loss of life, things will only become worse. I recognize it, in more ways than most would.\n\nNot only do women end up dying from illegal abortions, but the unborn still will. And, worse, it will lead to a backlash where it's once more legalized, and the anti-abortion side of things will forever be de-legitimized... no one will at that point listen at all.\n\nLeaving it legal, and reducing the demand, that's the only possible strategy I see. \n\n&gt; again you're assuming that easy access to something is magically going to reduce demand for it without evidence.

Some won't bother to use it, others will use it incorrectly, it will still fail.\n\nHowever, and I have no numbers to back this up, I believe that up to 10% of abortions could be averted, just by making it more accessible.\n\nI believe that doing something about rape could reduce it by as much as 5%.\n\nAnd I believe poverty policies would reduce it as much as 50%.\n\nBut right or wrong on those numbers, these policies make sense, both for abortion and for other problems we face.\n\nWhat if reducing poverty doesn't mean even one less abortion... wouldn't it still be good that we've reduced poverty?\n\n&gt; your conclusion was that laws were unnecessary to control behavior.\n\nI could care less about behavior.

Get over it, and help change the attitude that criminalization will fix things.\n\n&gt; You just don't value life as someone else might and feel that your judgement is better tha yours.\n\nHow can I not? I have specific goals, that of reducing the number of abortions performed each year (ideally zero). I've come up with a plan that will do far better at that than criminalization will.

Then, we throw in that sexual promiscuity requires that we dispose of the middle ground on demand. Divorce all of this from the current abortion debate.\n\nIn such a thought experiment, what do you think a society like ours will do? Will it decide that the middle ground here should be disposed of, no matter what the truth might be? I wanted to also include the condition that the middle ground was actually definitely \"people\", though hidden to everyone... but what's the point of that? The thought experiment works very nicely as is, showing just how little thought we ever give the subject. It's not important whether that's the truth, it's not even a consideration.\n\nOnly convenience is.\n\nThe religious have done more damage here by trumpeting their bullshit. I don't need Jeebus to tell me that murdering you or anyone else is wrong, nor does he need to weigh in on this.\n\nSome of the best things about humanity have been, that despite it all we've started to realize that some individuals are people too, despite our prejudice, our hatred, our need. Women weren't really human, black slaves weren't. The congenitally deformed or retarded. Jews. You name it. But we've grown up, and owned up that we were wrong on all of those. We need to do it this time too.\n\nThere are real solutions, solutions that would be agreeable (if grudgingly) to everyone (well, except maybe the fundies) if we'd just try for once, for fuck's sake.\n\nGet rid of \"abstinence first\" sex ed. Make contraceptives available to all, for free, 100% subsidy. Free rubbers, free vasectomies, free depo, whatever your favorite is. Make it available to anyone, age 12 and up, in such a way that they won't be embarrassed to take it. In schools, this means a room where you can go in and pick up a handful of condoms, without some school admin monitoring it.\n\n(This would also cut down on STDs, as a bonus.)\n\nCrack down on rape, harshly. Make it so rapists don't get released just to do it once more. Make it so that victims aren't put on trial. Make it so that they aren't ashamed to come forward, to report it.\n\nAnd finally, do something about poverty, instead of just paying lip service. This doesn't mean tweaking how many food stamps people are entitled to, it means actually getting them real jobs that they can survive on and not be miserable.\n\n(This reduces crime and drug use, as a bonus.)\n\nThat's what I want to happen. Criminalization is a fool's strategy. You don't have to agree with me that a fetus or a zygote is a person for any of this, it makes sense on its own.
