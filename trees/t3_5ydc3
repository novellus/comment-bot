But if they don't get their act together soon, gold will \"remonetize\" and that's when all freaking hell will break loose.  \n\nTo get a hint of what that means:  in 1930, there was about $35 dollars in circulation for every ounce of gold held the US mint.  In 2007, that number is more like $35000 dollars.  Currently, supply/demand fundamentals say that gold has no choice but to go to $1600 per ounce.  But to me that's not the issue, the issue is whether gold will be forced to remonetize.   If Hillary Gore or Rudy get elected, a dead dollar is almost certain.  If one of the middle candidates gets elected it's 50/50.  If Ron Paul gets elected, he'll probably save the dollar by killing the Fed - gold would still likely spike to $2000+/oz, but the dollar would be saved.", "author": "argoff", "created_utc": "1192510817", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 3, "parent_id": "t3_5ydc3", "id": "c029fig", "author_flair_css_class": null}
