When TSA testers, who are generally upstanding citizens with no connection to fringe or extremist groups, try to smuggle contraband aboard, they have an easy job. When a likely terrorist does, especially post-9/11, they have a much harder time.\n\nLook at cases like Nezar Hindawi's pregnant Irish girlfriend, who was caught before boarding with a bomb in her carry-on that she wasn't even aware of (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nezar_Hindawi).  Practically, everyone cannnot be screened at the airport with the same scrutiny, which means crazy college kids and TSA testers will always be able to smuggle \"simulated explosives and bomb parts\" aboard. It's simply the nature of the beast.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
