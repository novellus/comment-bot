Perhaps that's being worked on now. But let me suggest another idea: allow us to vote\non redditors as a whole. If I see someone who not only submits good stories, but also consistently\nmakes interesting and valuable comments, I'd like to be able to vote that person up. I would also like to\nbe able to bring up a list of \"most liked redditors\"; this way I can go straight to their user\npage and see what comments they've made to what stories.

I think people have a difficult time divorcing themselves from their comments as is.  One might submit a poor comment, but it's only the comment that is down voted; it's not him or her that is down voted.\n\nIf implemented, I think it would just become the \"two thumbs up\" vote on a submission.  Whenever anyone submitting something particularly insightful or cool, some people would vote for that comment or story then again for that person who submitted it.  I doubt any sort of restraint would be used.  \n\nBesides, I think there already is a means by which individual contributors to reddit are given accolades for their contributions and that's reddit's friend system.  Whenever you add someone as a friend, their name shows up in red.  So you know that that is someone you've taken an interest in.  I don't know if this is available, but I think one could do a most liked redditors on the basis of their friends.  For instance, I have [dons](http://reddit.com/user/dons/) as my friend because he submits great stuff on Haskell.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
