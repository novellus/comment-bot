I know it's only a release candidate, but I can't help but feel both excited and disappointed with Gusty Gibbon.\n\nFirst... that fscker is easier to install than Windows.\n\nThen, there's the subtle disappointment as you attempt to load it on all the laptop displayed at your local big-box retailer (about a 20% success rate... ran into one that prevented me from even trying at the BIOS level after booting from the CD).\n\nThen you get excited again because you can get some mid-life dual head card working with only a modest amount of googling.\n\nAfter that, you realize that Miro doesn't work after some random package gets installed and nobody on the Miro forms knows what the fsck is going on.\n\nThen you see how some of the advanced graphics look (in the appearance section); the extra eye candy is nice and it doesn't fsck over everything you've already learned to use in the GUI (unlike vista)\n\nThen you realize that all you really need to do decide if you want to try to cram all your legacy windows software-past in wine or if a Xen DomU would be better suited for dragging windows xp kicking and screaming into the next 5 years of it's pathetic life.\n\nAnd you think yeah... I can backup my DVDs without becoming Bill's DRM bitch or getting ass-fscked every 6 months by Apple.", "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": "1192540556", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5ydhq", "id": "c029gtm", "author_flair_css_class": null}
