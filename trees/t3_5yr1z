I'll note a few things:\n\nFirst, like the obnoxious protester in this video, fine, you want to discuss it, let's do that in a NORMAL manner. No matter how terrible what you think the truth may be, there are things that aren't even hidden truths, and require just as much, if not more attention, but all us big boys and girls sit down and talk about it like adults. \n\nHave an idea about AIDS in Africa? Great. Yelling at me about it? Not so great. This isn't to say that you shouldn't do anything about it. In fact, the opposite is true: when you yell and act like a moron, nothing gets done about it because you're just being annoying.\n\nSecond, all these videos of Rumsfeld, Kerry, Bush and so on apparently giving up the conspiracy is pretty insane, for a few reasons:\n\n* This is ignoring the fact that these are all people who talk A LOT, and this is a particular issue that politicians talk a lot about. I'm sure most have seen it, but think how many times 9/11 was mentioned just in the RNC (check out the [2-minute RNC video](http://&lt;a class=\"linkification-ext\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com\" title=\"Linkification: http://www.youtube.com\"&gt;www.youtube.com&lt;/a&gt;/watch?v=3cgR-N_RzLE) to get an idea). Hell, Giuliani probably mentioned it 14 times since I started writing this comment. Is it possible these are gaffs, and not the thread that is going to unravel this huge conspiracy? Because, after all...\n\n* You're assuming that if there was a conspiracy, it would apparently involve all levels of government, and even include members of the Democratic AND Republican party. Yes, I know, they're the same thing, and perhaps ideologically I think the differences are blurred, but they are in fact separate institutions. How was this done? A memo was sent to Rumsfeld, Bush and Kerry telling them about 9/11 in advance? That just sounds dumb and not very plausible.\n\nI do believe there have been what can be called \"government conspiracies\" many times, and the Freedom of Information Act gave us a few of these implemented during the Cold War. But all the details point out that they're not conducted in the way conspiracy theorists on this issue point out. For instance, why not, instead of trying to fake a plane taking a building down, have the CIA fund a group secretly and have them carry out the operation, possibly pulling a few strings in the background to make it easier? (Note: I definitely DO NOT think that's what happened). That just makes a lot more sense.\n\nAnyway, if you just decide to gloss over this, at least have the decency to not make as much as a clamor.
