I think we should consider that value is not absolute.  It really depends on who you ask.  Different parties evaluate differently based on their needs and biases.  That company might be worth more to Yahoo than to others for strategic reasons unique to Yahoo -- for example, if Yahoo perceives them as a potential future competitor.\n\nSo in the case of an auction for a one-off good like a company, I'm not sure consdering the mean of bid samples is necessarily a good measure by which to calibrate your own value.\n\nSomething else to consider is, what about the sample points for everyone who effectively bid zero for that company, by not bothering to bid?  Should we incorporate those samples in the measure of mean value?  Maybe there's a good reason to ignore this as an edge case -- people who bid zero have zero chance of winning, for one thing.
