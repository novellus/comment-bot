New divorce cases can be pain and they're never clean.  It's highly adversarial, as you have to file a shitload of paperwork, deal with another attorney on the other side (who's looking out for their client), set up child support, and try to distribute marital property in an equitable manner.  Client emotions are high, many need their hand held so the attorney becomes a counselor as well, and divorced clients rarely pay their bill after the divorce is final.  It takes six months in my state to finalize a divorce (three without children involved) and even after the judgment of divorce is completed, the attorney STILL has to file orders destributing pensions and the like, if applicable.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I couldn't handle the stress.  All kinds of crazy, unforeseen crap happens in these cases, like a soap opera from hell.  But plenty of attorneys can handle it.\r\n\r\nBoth medical malpractice and personal injury cases require a lot of work but the money can be good if you can get the right case.  But that's a waiting game.\r\n\r\nAside from Social Security appeals, another good specialty is workers compensation.  It's a lot like Social Security work except you're working against the company's attorney (who never want to pay for worker injuries) and you have to depose doctors to put the injuries on record.  But the payoff can be sweet.  An attorney I know came aboard on a recent case during the settlement process between the worker and the company, negotiated a settlment (took no more than five or six hours total), and walked away with $15k, just like that.

It's completely non-adversarial and basically forwarding medical records to the Social Security Administration.  In the last two weeks, the guy has pulled in over $20k.\r\n\r\nAnd you don't even need to be an attorney to handle SSA appeals.  You can sign up to be a Representative with only a Bachelors degree.  The only difference is that you have to petition the judge to approve your fee after the case is won, where an attorney does not.  I considered doing this myself because the allure of money is strong but I would rather do something more personally satisfying.\r\n\r\nAnother attorney in the firm works even less, doing domestic relations.

Attorneys I know make a hell of a living and barely work full time.\r\n\r\nLaw is fine as a field but the only way to do it with dignity is to start your own practice.  You'll starve the first year or two while you build a client base but you don't have to bill hours for anyone but the clients.  Barring that, get to know some successful sole practitioners who may want some young blood around and is willing to carry you during lean months.\r\n\r\nStay away from family law.  It's a soul-draining endeavor.  And the only money you'll get from clients during divorces is your retainer.  After that, they generally don't pay, or take a decade to pay off the bill.  And then bitch about how expensive it is even though you kept his wife from taking the shirt he walked in with.\r\n\r\nOne thing they don't teach in law school (and should) is how to run a law practice.
