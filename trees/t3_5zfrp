The Israeli human rights organization B'tselem said in November 2006 that \"the broad scope of Israeli control in the Gaza Strip creates a strong case for the claim that Israel's occupation of the Gaza Strip continue.\" [1] University of London, School of Oriental and African Studies, law professor Iain Scobbie noted in 2006 that \"Israel retains absolute authority over Gaza\u2019s airspace and territorial sea. It is manifestly exercising governmental authority in these areas.... it is clear that Israeli withdrawal of land forces did not terminate occupation.\" [2] And according to some Palestinians, Israel's occupation of the Gaza Strip continued. \"They control the water, the sky and the passages. How can you say occupation is over?\" said Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat in 2005. [3] Similar viewpoints have been presented by many other Palestinian organizations and leaders.[4][5] [6] The Al Mezan Center for Human Rights also argues that the Gaza Strip remains occupied by Israel.[7]\n\nPrior to Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, the United States considered the Gaza Strip to be an Israel-occupied territory. Following the withdrawal, no official US government statement has been made on the status of the Strip. However, the CIA World Factbook (which is an official U.S. government publication), which was last updated in 2007, continues to list the Gaza Strip as an Israeli-occupied territory.\"\n", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "politics", "ups": 3, "name": "t1_c02c6mn", "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5zfrp", "retrieved_on": 1427424973, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02c6mn", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02c6kq", "body": "From technical standpoint there is no such thing as \"Palestine\"...
