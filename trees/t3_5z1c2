However, if you don't think you'll have time to play all of the games before the end of the voting period, you are encouraged to play them in random order. That way, you will have played a random sampling of the games. You can do this using the game information and voting\r\npage at http://ifcomp.org/info/. The page has information about all of the games, and will list them in random order if you so wish.   \r\n\r\nRate each game you play by giving it a whole-number rating from 1 to 10. Larger numbers are better. Your rating must be based on no more than two hours of cumulative playing time. If, after playing a game for two hours, you want to keep playing it, you must give it a rating *and not change that rating later if you resume play*.\r\n", "author": "mycall", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "id": "c02b35l", "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh03", "name": "t1_c02b35l", "parent_id": "t3_5z1c2", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}
