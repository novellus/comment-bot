Thanks, Germany. You really managed to capture the majesty and grandeur of the subject \n\n&gt;After misinterpreting several scenes in the Wizard of Oz (1939) Hitler ordered his scientists to begin designing flying monkeys of his own, to match up against what he perceived to be a new Allied super weapon. This costume celebrates that moment, the darkest chapter of the war.\n\n&gt;What\u2019s wrong Germany, couldn\u2019t you find a boomerang to give him?\n\n&gt;These two represent the two houses of German parliament, according to an update we just posted on Wikipedia.\n\n&gt;Do you see this Hillary Clinton? Do you see?! Look into the true face of socialized medicine! \n\nWhile the costumes were funny, I swear they were more of a vehicle for some anti-German sentiments of the author.\n\nEither that or the author just fucking sucks at making fun of costumes, and really wants to be the guys from SA.", "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c02akqc", "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c02akqc", "parent_id": "t3_5yuik", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}
