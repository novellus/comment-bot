Well, there are probably an infinite ways that we can design a system of monetary exchange for commerce.  In terms of concepts, here are four:\n\nAt one extreme would be a system in which the people could issue their own money - for this a system of trust would be required and has already existed in the past under Common Law and Civil Law so that the people must uphold their contracts to repay in work or material.  This is a distributed system which encourages equality and the distribution of wealth (A 'Brother Joe' system).  One that avoids having all money issued as debt - a bill that must be repaid to another body - the banks.\n\nAt the other unfortunate extreme that we have today, all money is issued as debt from private banks (supplied as one currency by the Federal Reserve), people and their corporations (collections of people with ownership and organization) take loans and then must compete to pay off this debt.  But there is never enough extra money issued to pay off all the debt, so eventually more and more corporations and assets become owned by the banks.  There is a transfer of wealth from everyone holding the currency (say US Dollars) every time new money is introduced centrally, and there is further transfer of wealth as not enough money is introduced into the economy to pay back the debt and so bankruptcy and foreclosures occur.  The rich become rich as they are the first ones to have the newly issued money, this then relies on 'trickle down' and the poor remain poor simply because of the monetary system forced upon them.\n\nThe third is where the government issues money and introduces new money into the economy (this can occur in many many ways), but also collects tax and removes money from the economy.  Money can be issued such that it benefits all the people and not just the 'elite' few.  However, the rich probably lobby (bribe) the politicians and gradually shift it to a system where the rich benefit most, and so end up like the second concept above.\n\nAlso, there is the possibility of limiting the second and third by forcing it into a standard that can hardly change to avoid the inflationary pressures of issuing new money centrally by the banks and the transfer of wealth to the money printers that this entails.\n\n...I would advocate a more distributed system like the first concept in which people can trade with the money of their choice and even issue it themselves - although this shall be protected.  Although I won't go into detail here, similar to the system that existed after Independence and brought the US to become powerful and free.\n", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "name": "t1_c02bwk4", "parent_id": "t1_c02bwf6", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 2, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5zbnb", "retrieved_on": 1427425106, "id": "c02bwf6", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02bwf6", "parent_id": "t1_c02bw3n", "body": "What would you advocate instead?", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_6", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 10, "author": "danielsoneg", "created_utc": "1193635992", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_6", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 4, "author": "moneyprinter", "created_utc": "1193636114", "children": [{"subreddit": "reddit.com", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 1, "author": "zorno", "created_utc": "1193662066", "children": [{"controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "created_utc": "1193688258", "name": "t1_c02c0v2", "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5zbnb", "retrieved_on": 1427425048, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "body": " It might help giving people a place to start, otherwise they may be overwhelmed, or worse.\n\nThe worst part is that some people don't want to be educated or know what is going on in the world.

However, the purchasing power loss is implicit in that definition because each dollar can no longer buy as many goods. That rise in prices can come when the money supply is increased because if the central bank prints $1 and gives it to every person, then each person is going to demand $1 more of goods (ignoring savings which would dillute the effect somewhat). This increase in demand will push prices up.\n\nThat would be a loop if the Fed automatically  kept injecting money into the system every time someone wanted a new loan. Instead, when someone wants a new loan, i.e., demands more credit, thereby putting upward pressure on interest rates (the price of credit), the Fed can see the rates rise and take money out of the economy to push the rate back to where it was.\n\nThe Austrian Business cycle idea is interesting, though I can't say I'm an expert in the Austrian school in general. I do think though, that the business cycle existed even before the world converted to fiat currency, so that would seem to be evidence against its truth to the exclusion of all others.\n\nPersonally, I think that there is no single impetus that causes every recession or growth period. There are many things that can push the economy in either direction.

Hence the rise of prices due to supply and demand is not inflation, but the rise of prices due to the growth of the money supply is.\n\nYou said that interest rates decrease as the money supply grows?

Fractional reserve banking effects can be quantified and factored in to the Fed's decisions.

The Fed determines the money supply, which in turn determines interest rates. You're forgetting that the Fed doesn't directly control commercial interest rates, but only the money supply.\n\nFurther, inflation has numerous causes, one of which is the supply of money. An increase in the money supply, in the long term, causes price levels to rise (inflation). That same increase in the money supply leads to a decrease in interest rates as there is more money to go around and the price of credit (interest rates) decreases. The only effect interest rates really have on inflation is in how the rates affect the demand for money and the subsequent Fed decisions to alter the money supply to align it with the changes in demand.

Those people, in response to a decreased income, start saving money themselves, which takes money out of the pockets of the person who originally decided to save. And as this continues and the economy worsens, peoples' response is to save even more, not to spend more. Ironically, this action only causes the economy to plunge even further. Hence, a recession, and also a compelling argument for interventionist policies.\n\nBy the way, it's kind of pointless to argue with \"gold bugs\" to begin with.

Nothing in the article contradicts what I've said.\n\nThe Great Depression was caused by a combination of stupidly printing excess fiat currency (which I've already acknowledged as one of the drawbacks of using such currency) coupled with a run on the bank as people attempted to redeem gold-backed currency for the gold (which is one of the drawbacks of gold-backed currency).\n\nSo basically, people simultaneously invoked the worst property of both types of currency.  Having all gold-backed currency wouldn't have changed a thing, as a run on the bank caused by the already-in-progress recession (the one that prompted the printing of fiat currency in the first place) would *still* have crippled the economy.  \n\nThe main difference is that, with fiat currency, it takes an error by the fed, which hopefully employs economists who know what they're doing, to screw things up.  With gold-backed currency, all it takes is the mob mentality of the masses.  As soon as they see the economy tanking, they all want to stabilize their position by trading their money for gold, which just makes things worse and causes a downward spiral.\n\nOf course, there are some tricks banks can play, such as selling and buying bonds, that will keep things relatively stable, but the same can be said for fiat currency.\n\nSo no, a return to the gold standard is *not* going to magically fix the economy.

It may make the penalties more apparent, but it's not able to curtail stupidity.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons that fiat currency is a good idea, and plenty of drawbacks.
