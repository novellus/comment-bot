Well, it's not simple to explain, - but it goes like this:\n\nFirst, we had the 'Constitution for the United States' of 1787 and we upheld the law ourselves under 'Common Law' or 'Natural Law'.  Police and Sheriffs had no special power over anyone else as everyone was equal under the law in our Constitutional Republic. (A \"Brother Joe\" system of equality, with no \"Uncle Sam\".)\n\nAfter the Civil War, our government was bankrupt and so surrendered a parcel of land to the bankers in the 'District of Columbia Organic Act' of 1871 that established the 'District of Columbia'.  The bankers established a corporation called the UNITED STATES Corporation acting in Washington D.C. and agreed to pay off all the debts and pay for reconstruction and so on.\n\nFor this Corporation, they took up a \"goddamn piece of paper\" called the 'CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES' in 1871, which was slightly different than the 1787 'Organic' Constitution. - Having this Corporation allowed its owners to introduce its 'Admiralty Law' or 'Maritime Law' of the civil courts across the whole land to uphold its law of commerce for the benefit of the bankers.  The UNITED STATES Corp also slowly encouraged universal free education so that we could all learn the things we need to learn and become very efficient at producing work and material wealth for the benefit of the banks without knowing where money really comes from and who owns this country.\n\nThe banks were still opposed by the people in fewer and fewer numbers until 1913 when they were able to establish their Federal Reserve, and then in 1933 when they gained full control of the banking and monetary system.  \nThe UNITED STATES Corporation was then fully paid for by the Federal Reserve - a private corporation owned by the Corporation and the banks.  The IRS was then used to collect taxes that paid the banks directly.  So the people do not pay for their government, as it is not theirs.\n\nThe Corporation's CONGRESS, SENATE, EXECUTIVE BRANCH (WHITE HOUSE etc.) are all payed for from the Federal Reserve.  And, we the people do not have any ownership of the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe Incorporated UNITED STATES is actually only acting out of Washington D.C. and the other property owned by the Corp, like Puerto Rico, Northern Marianas, and other territories or possession of the UNITED STATES Corp.  But it has been able to spread its tentacles across the land, because of the Birth Certificate (to abandon your offspring to the Corporation's Department of Commerce, which becomes its legal parent).  The Corporation creates a legal 'Person' with Capitalized letters which is made for each human being that is a member of the Corporation, and the Social Security number which is assigned to each member of the Corporation, so you can pay into it as a trust member.\n\nIf you bought your property under the 'Person' name of all capital letters, then, as the Person is merely a legal identity owned by the Corporation, it is really the Corporation that owns the land, and they also expect that Person to pay tax. - The important difference between a human being that is born unto the mother and the 'Person', a legal identity in Capital letters that is created by Birth Certificate (or by Naturalization) and is owned by the Corporation.\n\nIf you are not a member of the UNITED STATES Corporation that was incorporated in 1871, then you don't need to pay the IRS.  And this is how some people and top bankers and the rich don't pay tax, and really do own their own land.\n\nTimeline:\n\n1776 - 'Declaration of Independence'.\n\n1777 - 'Articles of Confederation'.\n\n1787 - 'The Constitution for The United States of America'. - Not \"of\" The United States.\n\n1871 - 'District of Columbia Organic Act' established the UNITED STATES Corporation acting in Washington DC for which is written and codified 'THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA'.\n\n( U.S. Code collection - TITLE 28 &gt; PART VI &gt; CHAPTER 176 &gt; SUBCHAPTER A &gt; \u00a7 3002 &gt; (15) \u201cUnited States\u201d means - (A) a Federal corporation. )\n\nWell, there is a thousand-fold more information than this little snippet, and a number of people that have also abandoned their 'Person' and have stopped being a member of the UNITED STATES Corporation.\n\n(PS. be wary of the words 'MUST' and 'SHOULD' as well as 'PERSON', and capitalized names that all belong inside Admiralty/Maritime Law in the Corporation)\n ", "author_flair_css_class": null}
