It's difficult to frame an answer because, in my mind, the answer is essentially the definition of \"reason.\"\n\nReason is what we call our ability to form objective thought, and is therefore the basis of meaningful communication.  That is, two people who reason completely different ways cannot communicate beyond the superficial level.  Reason is how we determine what is \"true\" beyond direct observation.  The only way, in fact, that we've ever found to do so.\n\nTo base your \"mental economy\" on anything other than reason is insanity.  A mental patient might think themselves completely \"reasonable,\" but because the majority has implicitly agreed to reason in a different way, that is labeled insanity.  This majority view is more successful, at least in general, because it corresponds more closely with reality.\n\nTo base your \"moral economy\" on anything other than reason is either \"depravity\" or \"religion.\"  In this sense, these is no difference between the divinely-commanded \"moralities\" practiced by any religion or cult, they are all arbitrary.  To an Atheist, any valid morality must come from an honest evaluation of humanity and the necessary consequences of that valuation, no \"divinely inspired\" unfairness can be trusted.\n\nPerhaps a better answer to your question is that allowing un-reasoned opinion (especially when clad in the fa\u00e7ade of divine edict) to dictate man's \"mental and moral economy\" has proven not just unreliable (with no two sources of inspiration ever saying the same thing) but in many cases disastrous, as judged from our modern point of view.  Reason has proven both useful and reliable as the basis of nearly everything that separates our society from that of ten thousand years ago.  In short, we all trust reason, even those of us who resist it in some areas trust airplanes to fly, gravity to pull them to the ground and effect to follow cause.  Even people who buy lottery tickets and pray to a God (thoroughly unreasonable activities, based on their historical records) look for cars before they cross the street.\n\nTo resist application of reason to any aspect of life is inherently \"unreasonable.\"  That's something of a tautology, but reveals how pervasive is the acceptance of reason.  I would venture to say that most disagreements are based on opposing ideas of what sort of reasoning is \"right\" or the facts to which reason can be applied, often both.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "parent_id": "t1_c02c29x", "id": "c02c2qw", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "ups": 2, "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5zd98", "retrieved_on": 1427425030, "id": "c02c29x", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "name": "t1_c02c29x", "parent_id": "t1_c02c01x", "body": "\"\"Reason can never be the absolute dictator of man\u2019s mental or moral economy.\"\n\nBut why not?
