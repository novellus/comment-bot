There are several InfoCom-based games for Linux, you just need to put up with a text interface.\n\nHowever, if your definition of quality is limited to RPGs, you're setting up your query for a null set; All of the RPG developers of late have been big-budget console-developers, because it takes a huge investment in graphics, sound and interactive plot.  Not to mention an engaging combat system.\n\nYour modern RPG is less about plot and more about engaging players in new combat systems and wowing them with new graphics--And developing those is expensive.  People who want plot watch TV (such as it is) or anime.\n\nNow, if you can step away from the RPG genre, there's plenty of interesting OSS games out there.  Programmers might be interested in CoreWar, DroidQuest or RealTimeBattle.  Civilization fans should look into freeciv.  RTS fans (Especially those who liked Total Annihilation) should look into [Spring](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=5&amp;url=http://taspring.clan-sy.com/&amp;ei=SOcaR623EpTiiAGvh8WfAg&amp;usg=AFQjCNEv0eCt72xHC2x1qv5SlZc9uYKJRQ&amp;sig2=Abk2Xz84ZtbEAajcZCrEqg). Even Debian comes with five or ten sidescroller games, including a couple text-only ones you can play over a text terminal connection. (Great if you're connecting from a box you can't install anything on.)\n\nAnd, of course, there's Quake, Quake II and Quake III.  When id was done with each engine, they GPL'd them.  You can get free (legal) gamedata for them, too, so you don't need to own a copy of the original game.\n\nSorry for the general lack of links...This comment's already taken what feels like half an hour to write.
