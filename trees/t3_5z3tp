This is true for many high paying executives as well as low to medium level zombies.  However, after experiencing this I have come to the realization that a life without purpose is not a worthy life to live.  You are simply wasting your time and doing nothing to contribute to humanity or contribute to yourself.  Yes, some of us use our time wisely and learn and read articles but most of these types of \"lazy\" people are wasting their lives away.  ", "author_flair_css_class": null}
