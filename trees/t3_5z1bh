This is criminal behavior by our government on top of criminal behavior (War Crimes btw is executable offense). Covering for high crimes is also executable. Not my opinion, federal law. Someone needs to execute these gangsters in disguise, and hopefully heads will roll in the next election and we can actually reverse the unconstitutional Military Commissions Act of 2006 and get condi rice, cheney and bush to the Hague and have them executed. Plus life imprisonment for everyone part of this.  Federal law mandates this, they are just ignoring it because they politicized the Attorney General's position.", "author": "rook2pawn", "created_utc": "1193274375", "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "id": "c02b5op", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "politics", "name": "t1_c02b5op", "parent_id": "t3_5z1bh", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}
