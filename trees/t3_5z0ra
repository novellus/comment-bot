We ended up moving out of our government assisted house in the middle of the night so that no one could forward our address to creditors. We lived in a silver trailer (the kind you pull behind a truck) for six months at one point.\r\n\r\nMy parents instilled a love of learning in us, my mother had a degree in teaching and helped make learning fun. We worked hard and were home-schooled. I graduated from HS at 15 and started a computer repair company for local businesses. By this time we were living in TN.\r\n\r\nMy oldest brother scored in the top ten people nationally (not percentage) the year he took his GRE, and is a molecular biologist.\r\n\r\nMy oldest sister owns a 6 thousand sq ft Victorian home (with carriage house in the back) that she uses to help young singles get on their feet.\r\n\r\nMy brother above me is a wealthy Vice-Pres of marketing for a multinational B2B company. He traded in his Z4 for a bike 2 months ago because he needed the exercise and hates the materialistic consumerism around him.\r\n\r\nIf your willing to sacrifice much, there is much to be gained.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that can combat poverty is the willingness to fight for what is good and beautiful, to not feel like a victim. Whole communities can come out of poverty just by coming together and helping to supply one another's needs. If your in a repressive community where this will never happen, then stop complaining, hop on a bus and leave.\r\n\r\nThis cycle doesn't just happen in black communities, look at the corruption and economic depression in northern Ohio. No one from the community ever stood up for the community, no one was willing to give up their small sense of security (be it a union pension, personal freedom, or their life) for the people around them. And now it's too late, the only option is to move out. \r\n\r\nSo if you feel stuck, hop online at your local library, find a list of \"best places to live\" and then move there. Forget any ties to your old destructive community and try to take on the mindset of your new home, change the way you talk (I now sound like a Midwesterner and don't talk nearly as fast) so that you can effectively communicate with those around you. Don't be so stuck on \"being who I am\" and just have fun re-inventing yourself. \r\n\r\nEdit: Oh, and I know people who have TRULY had life handed to them on a silver platter, about half of those people are sunk into despair and are going nowhere.

There is more religious freedom in the United States than in the European countries that continue to mix religion, money, and government far more pervasively than does the United States. In France, the state subsidizes private religious instruction. Do we wish to adopt the French approach of having the state pay for private religious instruction? In Germany and Spain, the state is involved in promoting sectarian religious education in public schools. Is this what we want? The Church of England in the United Kingdom has symbolic if not actual primacy. In Scandinavian countries, the state has long been involved in financing religious activities. (They are now moving to disestablish their churches, just as Americans did 200 years ago.) In all of these countries, religion receives more financial support from the state than it does in the United States and, at the same time, religious activity is much lower. Does government funding of religion make religion lazier? Madison thought so and the European experience would seem to bear this out. It is difficult to understand why people might want to replace the successful American approach that has fostered religious freedom and adopt instead European models that appear to have been far less successful.\n\n[more.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_of_religious_freedom_in_France)\n\nThe French concept of religious freedom did not grow out of an existing pluralism of religions but has its roots in a history with Roman Catholicism as the single official religion and including centuries of persecution of people not endorsing it, or straying from the most official line, from the Cathars to the Hugenots and the Jansenists \u2013 this lasted until the French Revolution.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02b3r3", "id": "c02b4ab", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 9, "name": "t1_c02b3r3", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5z0ra", "retrieved_on": 1427425548, "score_hidden": false, "body": "Less political correctness.

Neither is the adoption of Suites, the whole world has taken that up as a sign of formal atire.  The only head of state I can think of that (which is a man) that doesn't dress in suites is the king of Saudi Arabia.  \r\n\r\nI would like to underscore that I believe subcultures are really important to our countries macro culture.  As a participant in several subcultures, I value them greatly, however my more deviant subcultures could (and reasonably so) be a detriment to my professional success.  \r\n\r\nI think a big part of the reaction to the Hip-Hop atire is not that it is not 'respectful' as much as the participants of this subculture tend to blame their lack of options on society at large's unwillingness to accept them _EXACTLY_ as they are.  When this attitude comes out society at large reacts with a fuck you, you don't wanna play then you cannot win.  This is how culture works for a very good reason, homogeniety is the root of harmony.\r\n\r\nI feel the same way as you do about freedom, however, conformity hath it's perks.

I do not feel this type of discrimination is appropriate when used with ethnicities.\n\nWell on this point I agree - it is discriminatory, and that's part of the point I've been making. I don't think that such discrimination is defensible, despite how common and widespread it is. At the end of the day, someone's sex, gender, sexual orientation, religion, political affiliation, age, style of dress, or linguistic dialect are completely irrelevant to their value as a person or ability to do a job. And I also think that it can cause cultural friction by creating a de facto requirement for cultural minorities to conform to the dominant culture that happens to reflect European anglo-saxon values.\n\n&gt; So there are two points where I disagree. First it is totaly reasonable to judge somone by their costume. This costume is not the sole property of blacks, and is not particuarly black in it's conception.\n\nI agree and I don't. I agree in that the black/white distinction isn't as sharp as its been made out to be. The costume in question doesn't represent black america, nor does black america represent the costume.\n\nBut there's still a racial component to this; we're talking about fashion that emerged from  primarily black inner city ghettoes, that's being criticized mostly because it's different from the \"respectful\" dress that's typified by white middle class America. (I found some of the replies to me rather funny, as they seemed completely unaware that the business suit was an invention of white Europeans, not some culturally independent universal way \"dressing well\").\n\nAnd while the specifics here don't date back much further than the 70's-80's, that doesn't make them any less relevant to the people who identify with them. To such people, it's very much a part of their identity and who they are - telling them to conform to the \"business suit\" culture is an attack on the cultural identity they've adopted for themselves.\n\nTo look at some alternate examples, we don't generally discriminate against Jews who opt to wear Yamikas, despite how stupid they might look. To do so would be an affront to their cultural identity, but it's a tolerance that's not extended to all cultures and races.\n\nIs the case really different here? I don't know - it's impossible to jump into someone's head and say whether something is really an important part of their identity. And as one of those middle class white dudes, I'm certainly not qualified to say. In some cases it is, in some cases it isn't, but as it's impossible to judge I think we should err on the side of personal choices. Also, I can't help but think that if black people all followed Bill Cosby's advice, and fully assimilated into white middle class culture, America would lose a big part of itself. The same goes for hippies and goths and whatnot - we shouldn't arbitrarily limit how people may express themselves, whether by civil legislation or social stigmatization.\n\nIn general I simply believe in free speech, free expression, individuality, and respect for others.

This costume has it's many cultural connotations, similar to metal head or hippie or goth and the many different costumes those subcultures have.  I refuse to believe that you can dress and act however you want, and succeed, unless you are a musician.  \r\n\r\nNow I fully understand the racial connotations associates with the costume.  However I would not have to throw very many rocks before I hit a latino or white person in the same or very similar costume.  \r\n\r\nSo when someone wears the costume of a subculture, is it not appropriate to assume that they carry the values of the subculture?\r\n\r\nJust to be very very clear, the costume is not black.  Black America is a diverse and interesting portion of america.  I mean for fucks sake no one is talking about the cultural roots they have going back to sharecroppers, and that subculture (if that is appropriate in this case) is cherished to this day by everyone for it's musical heritage, and that is a probably more exclusive experience to blacks vs. whites.

It most certainly exists.\n\nSo to does \"acting white\" - we just typically don't think of it that way, rather we think of it as \"normal\" and judge every other culture and subculture against that yardstick.\n\n&gt; Your clothes do not define you.\n\nSome feel that they are defined by their clothes - from people in expensive business suits to fashion slaves to the black kid growing up in the ghetto. It's an outward statement about who you are, and as such it's important to people.\n\nPersonally, I don't give a flying fuck either, but that's the difference between myself and some of my detractors in this conversation: they quite clearly do consider the business suit more worthy of respect than urban fashion, and let that choice of dress define the person wearing it.\n\n&gt; If you can not speak proper English\n\nThere are a lot of people of all types who are bad at grammar, spelling, and vocabulary, and generally have trouble communicating clearly.\n\nThere are also a lot of people who speak with different accents and dialects than you do, but nevertheless can communicate clearly and effectively, albeit sometimes heavier accents can be difficult to understand.\n\nJust going by the tenor of your post, I'll wager that there's one dialect in particular that you think sounds \"stupid\" and \"unprofessional\". I'd also wager you'd try to conflate that dialect with the first kind of person I described, which says a lot more about your own prejudice than the linguistic style in question.

Your clothes do not define you. Now that may not be practical and if you want to be successful and live a comfortable life then you have to conform somewhat and dress up for work. It's just a fact of life in this country. If you want that to change then you will have to conform somewhat and get in a high enough position of power that you can start to make changes. That is a social issue that is not going to change over night.\n\nHow you act and treat others does define you however. If you can not speak proper English then how do you expect to get anywhere in life living in the united states. If I decided to move to Japan and refused to speak Japanese then can I blame the Japanese for my failures in life because they didn't accept my cultural differences? How about I start speaking in \"LOLCAT\" from now on in all my interoffice emails? I'm sure I would get really far in life that way. There are just some things that have to be accepted as a general consensus in society, one of these is that if you want to express yourself in a respectable way then you need to speak proper English.

I'd like to apologize for creating the impression I was denigrating the whole culture...I'm certainly not. African-American culture has given this country many of its most valued cultural innovations and has contributed immeasurably to the evolution of our society. I think it offers a lot and will continue to do so.\r\n\r\nI worked in the Minneapolis public school district last year, and while it's not my career ambition to be a primary educator, it gave me some interesting perspective into the issue, and it's probably why I feel as upset as I do. It seemed to me that the teachers didn't expect the kids to learn anything, and many of the kids had little conception applying themsleves to attain goals. There was a tremendous amount of fighting and apathy. It was very difficult. I loved the kids, but I felt helpless. The odds seemed pretty stacked against them. I think this is why I responded so positively to Bill Cosby's speech and hoped for more people to make similar announcements...I just imagined those 5th-graders hearing more and more of their idols saying that expensive shoes and disregard for education are not cool, and I thought that at some point the idea might start to sink in. Instead, the people those kids look up to often continue to tell them that gang-banging is acceptable and that good shoes are more important than good grades. Surely you agree that hearing more positive messages from respected sources would be a good thing for kids. Bill Cosby isn't really a respected source anymore...he's often seen as, well, pretty lame. And that's why I hoped that Will Smith and Kobe Bryant and, heck, Dave Chapelle would chime in. People, especially kids, only listen to people they already trust.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, I don't agree with Cosby's disgust with the black American English dialect. Dialects are cool. I like them. Unfortunately, to get by in this country, a working knowledge of the standard dialect is usually necessary, but I don't think that means people should be forced to speak it all the time.

My view is that one creates positive paths to places everyone agrees are desirable--security, money, etc.--as opposed to negative paths that attack someone for having the wrong culture.\n\nI grew up lower class, perhaps even poor.  I had lots of opportunities to do interesting things, and the encouragement of everyone around me to do those things. Even the thugs--the folks who ended up in prison--were supportive.  They saw themselves as taking a different--more dangerous, but worth it--path to the place I was trying to go.  In that way, they were no different than someone trying to succeed by rapping, or playing basketball, or comedy, or getting a PhD in CS... except that the odds of success were even lower. They might have gone my path but didn't think it possible for them. \n\nIt has been my experience that if people think they have a way to get to success they take it, and if they don't, they'll define their own path to success. I wish we weren't losing manufacturing jobs.\n\nAnyway, in my own efforts in this space, I've tried to work with others to fix the problems of the pipeline: create opportunities for young kids to see that things like building robots aren't just fun, but easily doable, and an opportunity for creativity.  Once that sort of thing become a possibility, other avenues open up. Once the kids just sort of assume that they will, say,  go to college, they do.\n\nMy mother, on the other hand, works more directly with parents to involve them in the everyday education of their children and themselves. I think it's to the same end, though: the idea of moving along a path becomes an assumption and things become easier.\n\nOne thing I do *not* do is denigrate the culture. Why would I? I identify with it, at least in a broad way, and so do most of my friends who are also Black. It turns out one can listen to hip hop, write reviews, occasionally even rap, and still be successful. It also turns out that one can be an apparently successful professor at a top-tier university and wear shorts to work whenever it's over 65 degrees.\n\nOf course, this is a short answer and hardly comprehensive.

I'm not saying anyone's uniquely at fault; I think the entire society (American society, not black society) needs to take responsibility for the issue.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02bath", "parent_id": "t1_c02baoa", "id": "c02bath", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c02baoa", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "ups": 1, "link_id": "t3_5z0ra", "retrieved_on": 1427425387, "id": "c02baoa", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02bahe", "body": "I appreciate the sentiment, but I feel obligated to point out that this conversation *has* been going on, and for a very long time.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 1, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5z0ra", "retrieved_on": 1427425390, "id": "c02bahe", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02bahe", "parent_id": "t1_c02badt", "body": "Credibility with the black population.

Cosby's rant rubs a lot of people the wrong way for very good reasons.  It's plainly insulting.  Is he helping or just letting loose his anger?  He's pretty much saying, \"You're stupid.  Your kids are stupid.  Your names are stupid.  For superficial reasons, no one should hire you.  And you dress like a jackass.\"  Now, tell me why black people should listen to that?\n\nCompare this to The Boondocks episode when MLK awoke from a coma and lost his shit and said nigga and told black folks to act right.  I loved that.  It came from a place of love.    And Aaron McGruder (the Boondocks creator) gained my trust as someone who wanted to attack an issue in an honest, balanced, and funny way.\nI love the Cosby Show, but when he spoke like this, many black people knew that in the minds of many white folks he just gave them permission to be prejudiced generalizers.
