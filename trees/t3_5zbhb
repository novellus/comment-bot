Seems that back in the 1940s they'd been conscripts in opposing opposing armies on the very island where they were later photographed toasting each other with champagne.\n\nThey were there to toast each other as the U.S. handed back the island to the Japanese.  Seems the island was no longer of use, let alone importance, to the U.S.\n\nOf course a lot of American and Japanese conscripts weren't in the picture.  Heck, at the time many of their fellow conscripts had been blown into so many pieces there was nothing left to photograph.\n\nIt was that photograph that instantly unwound the twenty-plus years of hard and soft post-war propaganda for the U.S. military machine that I'd been subjected to growing up.  It was then that I saw the sheer idiocy of being dragooned into fighting someone else's war so that they and their descendants could make some marks on paper and divide the spoils up amongst themselves.\n\nSo, if \"G.I. Joe\" becomes G.I. international peace-keeper, how much worse can that be than the proven idiocy of national -- and nationalistic -- armies?  Maybe if we can truly develop multi-national approaches to maintaining peace, there'll be more people in the next photograph.  Heck, there might not even be a need for that photograph...
