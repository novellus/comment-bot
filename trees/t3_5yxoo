Maybe the fact that the sentence began by the name of the *product* rather than the chipset made my eyes look elsewhere.\n\nAs for your observation, I see that as the greatest news for the linux kernel ever, as it's telling more about its maturity than anything else could. I understand how Greg could have a hard time finding cool hardware that is also unsupported. All the hardware I own is flawlessly supported under linux nowadays except for just this little bit of wireless and I couldn't say the same four years ago. Many thanks to all the people involved in getting linux to support nearly all the common hardware, I think linux, in fact, supports more X86 hardware than Windows Vista does now.
