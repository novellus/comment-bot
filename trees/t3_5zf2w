They chose not to declare waterboarding illegal in any of this legislation even though many outside of congress urged them to.  So, if the US congress chooses not to pass legislation making it illegal at the height of the controversy then what?   It's legal.  But, Democrats want it both ways, they want to bitch about the extreme interrogation methods but they don't want to clearly, specifically spell out what is illegal.  Democrats fear if these methods are needed but have been made illegal Democrats will be blamed if there is an attack which could have been prevented. So they play this little game with a nominee oh he said this or that instead of making extreme methods illegal.
