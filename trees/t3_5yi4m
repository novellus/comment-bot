In addition, he seems to be gravitating towards everything he hates, but from the other side of things.  \r\nIf atheists want to make a difference and \"show\" the religious groups that its \"okay\" to not believe in a god, we should act in a way that promotes peace, harmony, and good morals (we all know what i'm refering to here, treat people as you would want to be treated).  We can show that these good things and actions are not the work of a god, but rather the work of humans who truly believe in the autonomy of our species and our collective ability to work together and make the world truly great.\r\n\r\nSo maybe that was a bit cheesy, but honestly, the work done by Hitchens generally creates more problems for atheists than benefits.\r\n\r\nAlso, i should note that i do not believe in a higher being in the religious sense, but i do find wonder and awe in the way energy connects every bit of matter in the universe.
