This has not required sacrifice, just intelligent regulations that encourage energy efficiency and clean energy.\n\nTwo points:\n\nI'd be extremely surprised if the majority of CA's deviation from the average isn't due to CA being a largely temperate state. Most of its climate control is cooling rather than heating. It's much, much cheaper to heat by locally burning CO2-emitting fossil fuels than by using generated electricity. Cooling, on the other hand, is done exclusively through generated electricity, which can potentially emit much less CO2. Hence, you'd expect warm-weather states to emit less CO2 per person.\n\nRegardless, it's hard to take seriously Mr. Romm's argument that reducing CO2 emissions could ultimately be low-cost if this is the best example he can come up with. Real reductions in CO2 emissions will require massively restricting or restructuring the booming industrial base in China and elsewhere. We should want a gigantic Chinese middle class sooner rather than later, and if they emit CO2 like the U.S. middle class (or even the French), it won't matter how \"green\" the U.S. becomes.
