Most in-car security cameras record on a 24 hour VHS in super long play mode, which cuts down quality greatly because a normal double-length VHS only records 6 hours. In contrast, there isn't a memory stick big enough to hold a full 24 hour day in most digital video format, so VHS is really their only option. It does the job of discerning what happened just fine. BTW, target's security system (as well as Lowes and many other dept stores) costs around $2000 per motion-sensing camera. They usually only have two or three per store (among other non-motion-detecting cameras), so I doubt any police department would be willing to multiply that by 30 or 40 cruisers. \n\nOh, and if you want to put blame on something for being the reason police depts don't equip their cars with better cameras, thank the security camera sellers and 10x price gouging. To them, somehow a $100 camera and a $40 motion sensor working together is worth $2000, even though it costs all of $200 to make.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "parent_id": "t1_c02abhx", "id": "c02ac3b", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c02abhx", "ups": 1, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5yqm1", "retrieved_on": 1427425914, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02abhx", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02aaw6", "body": "and there is a limit on how much space those security camera's have?
