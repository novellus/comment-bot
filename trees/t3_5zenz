Number 25 is a 50 second film showing the arrival of a train. I'm sorry, it may show *\"the power the medium would wield over its audience\"*, but that does not give it a place in a top 25 horror list. The Jazz Singer showed the power sound plays in making a medium richer providing the technology for all the screams in future horror movies to come...but that movie certainly would never make a horror movie list. oy.\n\nThat said, I do like the inclusion of creepy pre 90's cartoons.", "author": "disidentadvisor", "created_utc": "1193718340", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "archived": true, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5zenz", "id": "c02c3nn", "author_flair_css_class": null}
