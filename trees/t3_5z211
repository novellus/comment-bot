In the original reddit article stating that they banned discussion of him amongst newer members of their forum, I actually defended these jackasses.  I assumed that it was a semi-reasonable response to a raid on their forums by a more fanatic group of internet Ron Paul whores (No offense to Ron Paul, I love him, but you have to admit there are crazies out there).  But after reading this, it is entirely apparent that they are obviously trying to undercut his impact that he is having on people from all walks of life in America.  I don't understand that they can seriously try to group his supporters in with D&amp;D nerds at a Dennys or not going to any sporting events...  In reality, Ron Paul is getting more and more support from across a Broad range of potential voters.  For instance, I am a Democrat, and am seriously considering voting for Ron Paul in the primaries this February.  I still haven't decided, because I like to hope he has a shot, and I don't even believe all those stupid polls released by the MM (I mean, I have never been contacted by a polling company, so how do I know that their covered demographic will accurately extrapolate across America), but at the same time, If I vote for Paul, and he doesn't win the primary, it will have taken a vote away from Barack Obama and that means that Hillary might win and then I am stuck between Hillary Clinton or another Whacked out nutjob from the \"right\" who is exactly the same as Bush and Hillary...\n\nPolitics is so confusing sometimes...", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02b7i3", "parent_id": "t3_5z211", "id": "c02b7i3", "author_flair_css_class": null}
