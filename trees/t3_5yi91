Spread this out over an enormous number of small-stakes games, where all of the players are for all intents and purposes are \"anonymous\" and no one would ever raise an alarm.\n\nI know that this incident isn't exactly related to that concept but it does highlight something about the nature of online gambling that I'm not sure very many people consider: insider cheating due to lack of strong external oversight.
