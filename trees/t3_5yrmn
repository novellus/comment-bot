Double jointed people have a very shallow socket, enabling more movement in both directions. Where ball-and-socket joints are concerned, people with double joints can intentionally and painlessly dislocate the bone completely from its socket and then move it back into position again. Shallow sockets, combined with bone ends that are smoother than normal, also help joints slip and move easily in any direction. Ligaments and cartilage that stretch beyond the usual extent impact joint flexibility in the same way.\n", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 2, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5yrmn", "retrieved_on": 1427425899, "id": "c02acpa", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02acpa", "parent_id": "t3_5yrmn", "body": "Anyone know who she is?
