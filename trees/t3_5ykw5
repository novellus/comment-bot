Perhaps not so much as those who want to make the notation easily machine readable, but one must keep in mind that mathematicians are generally writing for *other mathematicians* (be they professionals or students), and not machines.\n\nTo abuse your example above, I would probably not write down the definition of a function without unambiguously somewhere stating its domain and codomain, either explicitly, or by having context force it to be something in particular. (For example, stating that something is an automorphism of a group G unambiguously fixes its domain and codomain to be G). What you wrote above is not the definition of a function, it is simply a property which might be satisfied by a function. I also prefer the total derivative to partial ones, for instance, the derivative of a function R^m -&gt; R^n is a function from R^m to the space of linear maps from R^m to R^n. This can typically be restricted to components where needed. Where I use partial derivatives, I'd typically prefer something closer to your notation. Then again, I don't do much physics.\n\nUsing less ink to write things is okay if the stuff that you don't write is very easily determined by your audience. I think people too often forget that when mathematics is (well) written, like any other piece of writing, the audience is kept in mind. This means neither cluttering the page with baroque syntax, nor leaving so much out that they find it less than easy to understand what it is that you're talking about.\n\nThis applies to proofs as well. Boring the reader with technical details which they can easily fill in as they read, and very likely obscuring the core ideas while you're at it is just as bad as leaving out so much that it's impossible to follow the proof. The goal is not really something that is actually rigour*ous* in a machine-checkable sense, but something which is rigour*isable* in, let's say linear time by the reader. As one progresses and sees the same things over and over, what is necessary in order to express a concept gets more and more terse, because both writer and audience have more experience to draw on. They're communicating the ideas at the level at which they think about them, and not necessarily directly at the level at which they've been formalised.

A lot of papers establish their own ad hoc conventions mid-paper in a footnote or a parenthetical remark to elid certain information which is \"clear from context.\"  I consider this bad practice, but it happens all the time.\n\nAlso, realize that a lot of variables in math (especially in physics) are dynamically scoped as opposed to lexically scoped.

That is quite untrue. Calculus, in its proper context as part of Analysis, has lots of fun results from a purely mathematical perspective.\n\nLooked at in a particular light, Calculus is the study of the behaviour (and misbehaviour!) of real valued functions, various conditions (continuity, differentiability, integrability) you can put on them to make them behave \"nicely\", and how \"poorly\" they can still behave even under those conditions. It's also a subject that has lots of geometric appeal to add some visual aspect to that process, and to help build intuition for proving things.\n\nI think it's an excellent starting point. Perhaps not the most ideal one from a computer science standpoint, but good nonetheless.\n\nLinear algebra is another decent starting point, as it showcases many ideas which will occur in other abstract algebraic topics, while involving quite a bit of geometry. It's also quite a bit more applicable to CS, particularly graphics, but in many other places as well.\n\nFor discrete mathematics which would be interesting to CS people, enumerative and algebraic combinatorics (in particular the theory of generating series) is full of great ideas just waiting to be stolen and applied to data structures. Unfortunately, I don't know of a text which is simultaneously widely available, introductory, and has a decent presentation of the material. (As far as I can tell, it's one of those pick any two situations.)\n\nFor widely available and introductory, you might try \"Generatingfunctionology\". However, in my humble opinion it's awful. The overall approach is confusing, as are some of the definitions, and many of the proofs are way more complicated than they need to be. I struggled to understand its definition of exponential generating series, and I already knew very well at that point how exponential generating series worked.\n\nFor introductory and has a decent presentation of the material, try the University of Waterloo C&amp;O 249 and 330 course notes by D. M. Jackson. They're absolutely excellent. It might be tricky to get hold of them, but you could try calling up the math printing services. They'll probably ship them to you if you'd like.\n\nFor widely available and has a decent presentation, you might try \"Combinatorial Enumeration\", by Jackson and Goulden, which is nicely encyclopedic in scope, while maintaining a fair bit of expository text, but certainly isn't gentle.
