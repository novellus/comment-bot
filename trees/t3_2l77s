I played viola (and violin, though I was more serious about the viola) for about a decade.  Put them both down 10 years ago and didn't touch them.  Recently started playing the violin again and, goodness, it's hard.  I guess I'd forgotten how crappy it sounded when I was 10 or 11.  I still read treble clef, and thanks to frequent (but self-taught) guitar playing, my left hand is as nimble as ever and my ear is good, but for the first month it sounded like I was killing a cat, because my bowing was so erratic.  Every fourth note would ring so richly and clearly, but the next three would sound awful, and it didn't feel like I was doing anything differently.  Gonna keep practicing.
