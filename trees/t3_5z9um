But then, he's all full of forgiveness, claiming to still believe in the just-us system. This kind of blind injustice has to end. A good start would be for the states to revisit their age-of-consent laws. When were these age brackets set? Most appear to be from the 50's. Kids are getting it on at a lot younger age nowdays. Should a 17 year old boy go to jail for having consensual sex with a 15 year old girl? What utter nonsense. To be real nowdays, the age needs to be 13 for both sexes. I'd much rather see my taxes go towards sex ed over jail any day. \r\n\r\nBut then, such ideas are political poison.
