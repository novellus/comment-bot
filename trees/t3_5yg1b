I enjoyed a few seasons of The Apprentice for its cheesy phony-ness and laughed watching the pathetic business majors kow-towing to Trump every time he entered the room. Sure there were a few sharp ones, but the majority were idiots and thankfully Trump exposed them for what they truly were. But this new Celebrity Apprentice should take the cake with the most laughs per minute. Imagine Joan Rivers interviewing to work for Trump! A hoot!", "author": "weegee", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5yg1b", "id": "c029jrx", "author_flair_css_class": null}
