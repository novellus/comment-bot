Bush and the many republican (and some democrat) congressmen just effectively destroyed a bill that would recognize the Armenian Genocide. And now here you are, using information from an Armenian website to endorse the rhetoric of predominantly neo-conservative supporters of more war and the devestatation of more innocent civilians in the middle east. It's dispresepctful to the dead and all of the survivers and their families who are still unrecognized. I am sure that the families of the Armenian Iraqis recently killed by Blackwater representatives would be especially horrified by this post.", "author": "plehu", "created_utc": "1193852001", "downs": 0, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": "t3_5z7zg", "name": "t1_c02cepz", "author_flair_css_class": null}
