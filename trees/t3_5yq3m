On a pareto basis there are bigger fish to fry first.\n\nConsider how \"successful\" gene therapy is which involves nothing more complicated than inserting a single new gene to generate a single new protein within a living person.   Right now gene therapy is one of the most lethal experimental procedures known - the overwhelming majority of test subjects are killed by the procedure in all of its various forms.\n\nSo now, we're talking about creating virii which include an entire ensemble of genes which must correctly execute each function at exactly the right time and situation.   And because it's a synthetic virus, we're doing this from scratch or mostly so.\n\nSorry, as an engineer - someone trained to use nature for the benefit of man and trained to believe a design is only valid if it is empircially shown to actually work, the state of biotech and molecular biology is not mature enough to make this kind of science fiction a reality.   Just look at the (nonexistent) training of most biologists in systems theory and higher math (Diff Eq and above).  It's laughable.\n\nThe only caveat is the case of minor modifications of an existing virus to enhance lethality.  Which requires 1) having possession of a lethal agent, 2) having infrastructure to work with the agent (capital, salaries, etc.), and 3) having the knowledge to know what to do.   Since the only folks who have easy access to the pathogen, knowledge and resources simulataneously are government labs, the only organizations with a capability to create and deliver such are governments (can you say \"2001 anthrax attack\") and even then it has to be a well organized and funded government (can you say NOT Iraq).\n", "author": "mantra", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c02ae86", "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "name": "t1_c02ae86", "parent_id": "t3_5yq3m", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}
