Everyone seems to agree that her husband is being a prick, and that she deserves to be free from him. So if she finally wakes up one day and says, \"Screw this. I'm moving on with my life with or without a *get*\", how will the community react? Will they continue to support her, or will they follow the traditional laws and eject her, even though they all agree that it's wrong?\n\nIf the former happens, then the problem is solved. If it's the latter, then (IMO) the only way she will ever be happy is by standing up for herself and accepting that this is not a community she needs to be a part of.\n\nEasy to say, I know, and I don't pretend that that will be remotely easy for her to do.

It also has implications in the Conflict of Laws context when individuals have property in multiple jurisdictions or move between jurisdictions, particularly Israel.\n\nIn Canada, the civil courts were granted the power in 1985 to explicitly revoke this kind of religious obstacle to divorce.  Big uproar among religious groups at the time, of course, though feminist groups were strongly in favor.  But that didn't remove the contract law obstacles (Jewish marriages are governed by a \"marriage contract\" at the time of the marriage) and right now actually there's a case decision pending in the Canadian supreme court (Bruker v. Marcovitz) about whether the courts can step in to annul the terms of this type of religious contract.       \n\nNone of that is to say though that in her case she shouldn't just get out.  Property doesn't seem to be involved, and complex legal wrinkles don't seem to be involved.  She doesn't even have to leave Judaism, just switch denominations.  Some of her Orthodox friends will abandon her, perhaps her family will abandon her, but from the perspective of someone outside the situation, it's nuts to let an inchoate prison of beliefs chain oneself so totally.
