Most modern biologists, having reviewed with satisfaction the downfall of the spontaneous generation hypothesis, yet unwilling to accept the alternative belief in special creation, are left with nothing. ~ George Wald  \r\n\r\nOccasionally, a scientist discouraged by the consistent failure of theories purporting to explain some problem like the first appearance of life will suggest that perhaps supernatural creation is a tenable hypothesis in this one instance. Sophisticated naturalists instantly recoil with horror, because they know that there is no way to tell God when he has to stop. If God created the first organism, then how do we know he didn't do the same thing to produce all those animal groups that appear so suddenly in the Cambrian rocks? Given the existence of a designer ready and willing to do the work, why should we suppose that random mutations and natural selection are responsible for such marvels of engineering as the eye and the wing? ~ Phillip Johnson ", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 2, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5zf5h", "retrieved_on": 1427424932, "id": "c02c9ty", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02c9ty", "parent_id": "t1_c02c911", "body": "&gt;Without abiogenesis evolutionism is a non starter.\n\nCompletely, totally false.
