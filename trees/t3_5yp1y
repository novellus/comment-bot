Petco treats their employees like garbage, and corporate would never give us enough payroll to adequately staff the store (usually there was a cashier, a floor person, and the MOD).  My recommendation?  A store called \"Pet Supplies Plus\".  It's new to my area (Austin), but supposedly has chains around the nation.  Great service, knowledgeable staff, and the best deals on premium pet food you can find. \n\n(edit) and no, I don't work at Pet Supplies Plus.  I'm in QA now at a software company.", "author_flair_css_class": null}

I used to work in a grocery store when I was in high school, and one of the things you're supposed to do when stocking shelves is pull the older cans off the shelf, stuff the new ones in the back, and put the older ones in the front.  It's called rotating the stock, and it's meant to make sure that the older stuff is sold off before it expires.  Well, most employees were lazy and just shoved the new cans right in front of the old ones.  I was one of the few who didn't, and I remember finding cans that were 4 to 5 years out of date on the back of the shelves.  And the same went for the coolers too. I'd find milk, cheese, yogurt, eggs, breads, etc, that were all shoved behind the new stuff and way out of date.  (This store didn't have the coolers that you load from behind.)  I was rather surprised at the lack of concern on the part of my bosses.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
