When we overcome inequality, social hyperstratification, and economic plundering, then these questions will all be moot.\r\n\r\nBut until then, listen to me once, and listen clearly: our society has not made a commitment to overcoming poverty. We simply *do not care*, because if we did we would achieve equality. It's that simple. Human beings are, for lack of a better way of putting it, pretty decent creators of destiny and the interpreters of reality. If we wanted poverty to leave forever, it would. We would turn our attention to it, and solutions would become apparent. I mean, we've transformed titanium hulls into airplanes. We've split the atom. One or two measly private schools instituted to give a chocolate corporation or a defunct and dessicated religion a good name *do not cut it*. \r\n\r\nShow me some real commitment to ending the ravages of poverty, ignorance and inequality that plague our cities, and I'll retract my statement. Until then, the facts stand. All the evidence says that we, as a society, choose to avoid the problem rather than deal with it.

Therefore, your anecdote proves the point of going to a private school. All my friends with rich enough parents got sent to a college prep and ended up at Ivy's and now make 6 figures. I'm left to work for 5 hours a day for 12 cents to save up enough cash to use the Internet for 1 hour.

Home schooling was the best for me because I could have some say in what I was learning and the courses I could take.  This is just in my area (Pittsburgh) but my private school crushed the public schools.  Most of my friends from there are at Duke, Brown, Yale, etc while my friends from public school went to PITT, Dug., Robbert Morris, and more local school.
