Forget the Geneva Convention and the ethical concerns, although all valid, for a moment.  Let's say it would be OK to take extraordinary measures to protect ourselves from dangerous terrorists.  \r\n\r\nBut what we find is that the same confused morality it takes to come to that conclusion leads to incompetent decisionmaking.  They seize and detain, including for rendition, many people on little or no evidence.  Who knows what they're doing to these innocent people?  Then they have released some that are actual terrorists that have shown up again on the battlefield in Afghanastan.  The ones they keep are never actually tried and convicted, why not?  They can't posssibly have any relevant intelligence five years later.  And if all of this is logically defensible then at least you would be able to convince those in congress who have top secret clearance, but that hasn't happended either.  And then the worst part, when it's politacally expedient you get the Hick's plea bargain.
