And the story that explains how things should work is not the one about the OED but the one about space shuttle software.\n\n&gt; Lockheed Martin Corporation employs a Level 5 software group that puts together the shuttle software. This software seems large, and it is written by a deliberate process. Let\u2019s look at this.\n\n&gt; The software is not very big\u2014only 420,000 lines of code. This is not massive software\u2014it\u2019s off by a factor of 10 or 100. The software is monolithic, an unrealistic model for future systems. The software was developed over a 20-year period by a group of 260 people. These numbers imply that each line of code has had 25 person-hours of attention, and that each person has been responsible for a little over 1600 lines of code\u201425 pages. $700,000,000 was spent to develop this code, or about $1700 per line.\n\n&gt; Further, the software had been completely specified in pseudo-code agreed to beforehand. The task of a programmer in this regime is to translate pseudocode to actual code. But, all this work does buy NASA only 1 error in each of the last three releases of the code. Because we cannot afford to have deaths in the space program, the cost and effort are worth it. The cost amounts to making each subroutine a career-long research project. Twenty years, 8 hours a day, studying and eliminating errors from 1600 lines of code.\n\n&gt; ... We cannot afford to inch our way up the learning curve, 1600 lines at a time.
