It should take me at least back to the article that is currently live on the system.\n\nI didn't create a dupe submission.\n\nSo then I googled \"reddit What Shamu Taught Me About a Happy Marriage\" to get the first submission. Reddit search on the article title doesn't work yet of course.\n\nSo since the host of the article may actually move the URL during the normal course of business, even though this is a big no no, rather than wait for the perfect dupe detection solution, we should allow explicit linking between articles that are community identified as identical dupes.\n\nSure fix low hanging fruit, like denying resubmission based on URL termination string shenanigans, but don't also provide community dupe resolution facilities. \n\nBTW I know there are other copies of this submission floating around on reddit that have generated significant karma. I didn't find those yet. This article is a candidate for reruns.reddit.com.\n\nAlso submitted to feedback. ", "author_flair_css_class": null}
