They don't *care* enough to pay attention to politics.  They treat politics as if it were something annoying, trivial, and boring.  \n\n\"Oh, that's just politics\" they say.  Then in the next breath, they complain about the country going down the tubes.  About losing their job.  About losing their insurance.  About how the Democrats haven't ended the war yet.\n\nTo these people I say: if your government sucks it's because **YOU SUCK**.\n\nThere are places where people are getting their fucking hands cut off for daring to vote while Americans can't be bothered to show up on election day.  And those who are too lazy and media crippled learn any more about the candidates than what campaign commercials tell them.\n\nThe most effective means to get this country back on course is a progressive take-over of the Democratic party.  It's just sitting there, a ghost ship drifting aimlessly because its entire crew is asleep.  \n\nGrassroots Democrats are the crew.  Our job is to wake the rest of them up.

I've seen my efforts produce real political change, so I'm not so cynical as to abrogate my responsibility as a citizen.\n\nThat written, from my perspective, the Democrats and Republicans really are only superficially different. \n\nTheir foreign policy approaches differ mainly between *containment* and *rollback*, both of which I find abhorrent. Clinton and Giuliani, the two leading presidential nominees, are more or less interchangeable in their beliefs (and both frighteningly imperialistic).\n\nTheir domestic social policies range from moderately conservative to highly conservative (with some variation both within and across the parties). I don't see any mainstream Democrats speaking out in favour of, say, universal health care, a no-brainer social policy that nearly every other industrialized liberal democracy established decades ago. I don't see any mainstream Democrats speaking out in favour of same sex marriage, or absolute protection of a woman's right to an abortion, or a national minimum wage that gets people out of extreme poverty. They just tinker around the margins of today's deeply non-liberal, non-progressive systems.\n\nSimilarly, their economic policies are substantially the same, though the Democrats seem to be fiscally responsible in general, and more interested in balancing the books in particular.\n\nIn terms of their overall political ethics, the Democrats seem less overtly partisan and cronyist. Because the Republicans believe government can never do anything right (other than war and law enforcement, and even those benefit from corporate involvement), they have a nasty tendency to run government programs into the ground and then declare a self-fulfilling prophecy. \n\nThe Democrats, by contrast, try to appoint people based on qualifications rather than partisan loyalty and seem genuinely interested in making laws based on policy considerations rather than political dogma and vote buying.\n\nThat's a non-trivial difference, but even it seems to be eroding under the onslaught of the total Republican contempt for oversight, transparency, accountability, and the rule of law.\n\nAgain, when someone like Nancy Pelosi or Barack Obama says they oppose impeachment because it doesn't make strategic sense, they're sacrificing their oath to defend the constitution for political expediency. \n\n&gt;Apathetic defeatists deserve nothing but scorn.\n\nI'm not persuaded that causality flows one way in this dynamic. A political system that gets its momentum entirely from what elites want is guaranteed to induce apathetic defeat among non-elites who recognize at some level that the system is designed not to work for them and that the people who can change the system are *part* of the system.\n\nAgain, evidence from other countries demonstrates that people become more politically engaged when they believe that their engagement can make a difference. \n\nMost countries have a political system that allocates legislative power among parties based on popular support - i.e. some form of proportional representation. Those countries have more political parties, more engaged citizens, and higher rates of voting.\n\nMost countries have a labour-based political party. The US does not, mainly because anticommunism, HUAC, McCarthyism etc. totally depoliticized the unions in the early and mid 20th century. That's a huge political void - it's extremely difficult for atomized non-elite individuals to create concentrations of power big enough to counter the concentrations of corporate power that feed the two mainstream parties (i.e. the liberal and conservative wings of the corporate party).\n\nI don't know what the answer is, but I don't blame progressives who have given up on the Democrats. The Democratic Party is not a progressive party; it's a moderate big business party with a few slightly liberal tendencies. The US does not have a progressive party, nor does it have a progressive concentration of power adequate to produce and run a progressive party.\n\nI don't know what it would take to produce that, but I don't think you're giving apathetic defeatists enough credit for recognizing rightly that their ability to influence politics through today's binary partisan system is highly attenuated.\n\nAgain, I don't know what the answer is, but the way to an answer might lie in understanding why people feel powerless in the first place and doing something about that.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "politics", "name": "t1_c02a39a", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "ups": 1, "link_id": "t3_5ym0q", "retrieved_on": 1427426021, "id": "c02a39a", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "parent_id": "t1_c02a2zz", "body": " I'm sick of solipsist cynic pseudo-sophisticates abdicating their responsibility as citizens and then telling us patronizingly \"Democrats and Republicans are all the sames\" or whatever other bullshit.\n\nThese people's neglect *allowed* America to fall into the state it's in today.\n\nApathetic defeatists deserve nothing but scorn.

The Democrats are not monolithic and do not march to a single drummer. It's encouraging to see that Dodd, a nominee for the Democratic presidential candidate, seems to recognize the importance of demonstrating principled opposition to the Bush administration.\n\nUnfortunately, he's in the minority in his own party. Most of the mainstream Democrats are still under the mistaken assumption that their best shot at winning in 2008 is to be \"politically realistic\" about what they can achieve in the meantime.\n\nBush has about 25% approval (basically, the hard core of Republicans who would support him even if he ate those proverbial babies). \n\nCongress has only 10% approval. Republicans hate it because it's Democratic-dominated; and Democrats hate it because the Congressional Democrats keep rolling over and giving the Bush administration what it wants.\n\nIt's not enough to say Bush would veto their policies and they don't have the super-majority to overturn his veto, so why bother. The Democrats need to *force* Bush to exercise his veto. They need to take the principled stands and lose, so the record shows them at least *trying*. \n\nA long string of Bush vetoes of good legislation is the best thing the Democrats could take into 2008.
