A 40% increase in an extremely rare cancer is NOT medically significant.  First off, since heart disease is simply many orders of magnitude more prevalent than many of the cancer's mentioned.  \n\nSecondly, far more likely than the 'moderate drinkers have a healthy lifestyle in general' argument is that people who OVER drink, i.e., more than 3 a day, are very unhealthy people.  That includes smoking, etc. as confounding factors.\n\nThirdly, whatever excess cancers that ARE actually statistically significant(the breast cancer risk maybe, as breast cancer is far more of a problem than esophageal cancer) is most likely due to the PROTECTIVE effects of alcohol.  I.e, if you hadn't noticed, heart disease kills people earlier than cancer does, on average.  \n\nWhat would be interesting is looking at the risk of all cause mortality, rather than throwing fits about these insignificant relative risk ratios for otherwise rare diseases.  Keep in mind, being a Gemini increases your risk of brain cancer by 40% too.
