I don't know where you got the the idea that we have or ever had a free market!\n\nIf this were a free market and Enron was free to whatever it wanted, why exactly did it make large contributions? Just to give away money? The fact that certain corporations are able to bribe the government into doing what they want is NOT the free market; it is mercantilism. If anything, your example illustrates the dangers of giving too much power to the government. Because then, instead of convincing the consumers with quality products, all the companies have to do is bribe some politicians. Which is why most \"evil\" corporations love big government.\n\nLastly, how exactly did \"everybody\" get hurt with the mismanagement of Enron? There are always going to bad companies, because there will always be bad people. When corporations misbehave, only their shareowners are hurt, not the public.\n\nGovernment, on the other hand, forces you and me to pay for the war in Iraq and war on drugs and so on.

To tell the truth, I'm a bit shocked it was so enthusiastically voted to the front. \r\n\r\nThe title is dumb not just because it is misspelled, sensationalist, a bit rude, and a stupid dare, but because it doesn't tell us anything: are people voting up because they agree with RP, are they voting up because they want me to STFU, because they think this position is controversial and needs airing, because they too are frustrated with the \"RP mafia\"?  It's impossible to know.  \r\n\r\nHowever, on the positive side, I think the comments have thrown some light on the issue.  I expected most people to be disturbed by RP's position on this issue; a few are, but many agree with him.  This is a bit surprising to me.  It shows me, contrary to my expectation, that folks really are in tune with his right-wing libertarian philosophy.

I contrast **left-** and **right-libertarianism** (**LL** and **RL**).  I think that the right-wing variety does not lead to real liberty.  What it doesn't seem to recognize is that money is power, and there is a danger of tyranny by money. Money has power because creditors are granted the right to repossess goods by the state, backed by its coercive power.  **LL** opposes both overweening intrusive government authority and the dangerous controlling authority which emerges due to coercion by money.  \r\n\r\nThis is related to the idea of campaigns funded by the wealthy being the same as \"free speech\".  Was it Liebling who said freedom of the press is available to anyone who owns one?  Of course, the internet is changing things, but this promise holds only so long as we have network neutrality.  This is the same disagreement in a different area, and again Ron Paul, following **RL**, comes out against net neutrality.   I find that a frightening and dangerous prospect.  Liberty once lost is regained only at great cost.\r\n\r\nThe disagreement comes down to whether one has blind faith in the idea that greedy interests will always do what is best for all of us.  **LL** finds value in a public (\"publishing\") square not dominated by the views of moneyed interests.  **RL** shrugs: allowing power (in the form of money) to dominate is either optimal (most pragmatic) or correct (morally justified).  Of course you can listen to whoever you want to in a free society, but having only a few people with megaphones changes the overall dynamic.\r\n\r\nRon Paul argues that it is the total **RL** vision one has to accept:  reduce government power and there's less incentive for the wealthy to influence campaigns.  But does he think the wealthy won't try to influence votes if, say, people tried to strengthen bankruptcy protection or to erode property rights?  This is the root of it: capital will always seek laws conducive to growing capital.  **RL** seems to ignore that crucial feedback loop.

There will always be money in Government. The Government fights wars, someone has to make the planes and the bullets.\r\n\r\n2. Campaign Finance Reform doesn't limit \"free speech\". As a citizen, you can do pretty much anything you want to support your candidate - you can spend hundreds of thousands stumping for your favorite candidate or party - you just can't give those hundreds of thousands to the candidate so he can stump for himself.\r\n\r\n3. Actually, many \"corrupt\" politicians don't want to need to be \"corrupt\" anymore to get elected. There are really only a handful of types of politicians...\r\n\r\n{a} those who get elected without corrupt tactics (rare)\r\n{b} those who get elected with corrupt tactics who don't mind being corrupt (many)\r\n{c} those who get elected with corrupt tactics who don't want to be corrupt (some)\r\n\r\nThose {c} type candidates are the ones who passed McCain/Feingold. This largely Democrat-passed legislation actually targeted the Democrat's primary method of getting and distributing campaign funds (soft-money). \r\n\r\nYou see, Democrats have a smaller base of wealthy contributors, but those among them are BIG CONTRIBUTORS. The Democrats relied on the soft-money system of collecting big dollars at the national party level and distributing that money heavily down the chain to targeted campaigns. With new regulations on how soft-money could be distributed and utilized, it killed the DNC's ability to push money to its candidates who, by and large, were more popular among less affluent voters.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, the Democrats have had a much more difficult time getting elected recently, even in light of how atrocious our President is.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats did this to themselves though. They decided that getting soft-money, their primary source of corrupt funding, out of Washington was more important than winning elections. ", "author_flair_css_class": null}
