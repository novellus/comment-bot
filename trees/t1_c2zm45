When overused by aggressive law officers, or the person was a basket case, then the Taser just accelerates their demise. \n\nFrom Tasers website: \"The TASER ECD delivers a rapid series of shocks. Each has less current than a strong static electricity shock that one could get from a doorknob on a winter day.\n\nThe TASER ECD cannot stop the heart. While it has brief high currents, just like a strong static electricity shock, the pulses are significantly too short in duration to affect the heart. Since the pulses are each too weak to affect the heart a series of them will not affect it either.\n\nThe safety of the TASER devices has been verified in numerous human and animal studies. It is doubtful that any law enforcement use-of-force technique or tool has been tested so thoroughly for safety.\"", "author": "defendthyself", "created_utc": "1192575289", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "gadgets", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_c2zm45", "id": "c029kjb", "author_flair_css_class": null}
