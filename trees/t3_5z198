The devastation caused by the fires is enormous and we will get to know more of that in the next few days. But, I was moved by the amount of co-operation that all the city officials, san diego businesses and all san diego people demonstrated. It was incredible to witness how smooth all of the evacuation work has been progressing. The relief work is still not complete as of now, but I think that should not be a problem.\r\n", "author": "investwise", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c02b2wb", "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c02b2wb", "parent_id": "t3_5z198", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}
