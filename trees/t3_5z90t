I like your reply the first point:\n&gt;The laziness is not in which choice you make but in whether or not your choice is definitive.\n\nI hadn't considered that (my experience is with rather narrow minded fundamentalists, so I'm probably a little jaded). I want to retort with a comment like \"the laziness can also be in choosing the most convenient choice, without any *initial* consideration\", but I think we're looking at the same thing from different positions. As Robert Frost said, \"If society fits you comfortably enough, you call it freedom.\"\n\n\"The church gives me a sense of community\" gets murkier. It's the exception for an outsider to *choose* that community, you are generally born into it. I was born into it, and although it was difficult, that community's hypocrisy got me to re-evaluate my beliefs...\n\nOh crap. I just proved your point, didn't I? I *chose* to re-evaluate after the fact... Hmm...\n\nThankyou for giving me something to ponder.", "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02bofa", "ups": 2, "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 2, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5z90t", "retrieved_on": 1427425210, "body": "I took three of the reasons from your post that applied to why I would describe myself as religious and explained why it does not indicate what you believe it does.\n\n&gt;\"I have faith\" is not good enough. It shows a lack of critical thought.\n\nI can see why you might say this.  One common understanding of faith is of an unshakable belief that is never questioned, a belief in belief.  This particular type of faith seems in many ways to be a product of the modern world, a response to inoculate one's self to the constant changes taking place.\n\nBut faith can mean something else as well.  Because faith and doubt are twinned.  They are inextricably intertwined in today's world.  Authentic faith is impossible without doubt.  Mother Teresa was ridden with doubts to the extent that she was unable to pray for the last dozen or so years of her life.  To believe is to make a choice, the same as not believing.  \n\n*If one decides to make that choice once and never revisit it, you are being lazy - whether that choice involves being involved with a church, mosque, etc, or a choice not to be involved.  The laziness is not in which choice you make but in whether or not your choice is definitive.*\n\n&gt;\"The Church gives me a sense of community\" is not good enough. \n\nBased on your explanation, I think you are only taking one sense of community - the \"let's hang out and be friends\" sense.  There are several other kinds of community a church can provide: the sense of belonging to a group with a distinct identity; the belonging to a group that shares your values; the connection to history - your own and other's - that acting in a tradition grants you.  Each of these, including the one you dismiss, is worthwhile.  I would not say that any of these reasons though are sufficient to convince one to join a church though.\n\n&gt;\"The Church acts as a guide for me to live a moral life\" is not good enough.\n\nThis one is trickier.  Rather than trying to explain my response theoretically here, I'm going to explain my personal experience.  I am a Catholic, and I would say that the Church acts as a guide for me.  Yet, after careful consideration, I do not agree with the Catholic Church's position on a number of issues.  I find other aspects of the Catholic tradition that support my views; I find many Catholics that do as well.  The helpful thing about the Church as a moral guide is not that they should have the final word on right and wrong - which is one of the things about which I disagree with the Church - but rather that the Church can provide a baseline and the tools to evaluate moral questions.
