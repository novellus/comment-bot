Their pops ducked out, their mothers are addicted to drugs or working 24-7, the schools they attend are a mess, and you have the capitalistic machine warping their minds and lives just like it is for every one of us.

It is the suggestion that English does not INCLUDE the original language of these lyrics which I consider to be racist, for the reasons above. \n\nBut please also consider that people do not become musical celebrities with lyrics like: \"Although I am extremely unattractive, I am able to engage in these types of sexual acts with some regularity.\" Why is it not then to be presumed that what you are calling standard English, which term I consider to be racist in this usage (where it excludes the vernacular language of millions of English speakers, many--but by no means all--of whom are black), has the \"poor expressive capacity\"? \n\nThat is, people buy and love these songs because of some resonances that one doubts would be felt in songs with lyrics like the one quoted above, and the lyricist has historically shown his or her poetic license to the language police. By some estimates Shakespeare added thousands of words to the English language. Presumably, he was limited by the \"poor expressive capacity\" of the standard English of his day. No one speaks Shakespearean English, but one's unlikely to argue that we don't because of its expressive paucity; we'd be more likely to hear it's just too hard to do that. \n\nSo, to recap: I think it's racist 1. to say that these songs are not in English because they are in a translator-necessitating language that is named for black United Statesians, as if those black United Statesians for whom it is named are not speaking English, and 2. to ignore the lyrical intention and effect of these lines and to ascribe any opacity the reader finds there to their being in \"ebonics,\" rather than lyrics.
