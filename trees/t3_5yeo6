Then it says that OSS stuff can be bought out or abandoned.  It also could be compromised by hackers.\n\nWhat?  It's kind of hard to \"buy out\" an OSS product: you have a infinite-term license for it.  A company can stop working on it, but the community can pick it back up.  Compromising it?  Possible, but it's just as likely that your paid software is compromised.  Possibly more so, since there are a lot more people who double check their OSS stuff they download than people who worry about their commercial software.\n\nThis almost feels like an auto-generated page.  It's not, but it could be easily.  That whole site feels like it's there solely for ad revenue.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
