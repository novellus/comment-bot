I don't know if there would have been a significant distinction between the two descriptions at this time.\n\nI understand, here's why I nitpick about that.  Turkish nationalism is on the rise, and might turn into a destructive force (and I write this as a Turk).  The historic origins of its rise needs to be understood -- especially in relation to the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire and her territories in Iraq -- to put the current goings on in their proper historical context.  Anyway I'll give you one more interesting tidbit (which you perhaps know), the deposition of Abdulhamid-II who was the last powerful Ottoman monarch is commonly referred to as the 'Young Turk Revolution' but the comittee sent to [depose him](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Abdul_Hameed_II_Removal.gif) consisted of a Jew, an Armenian, a Georgian and an Albanian!  (All Ottoman subjects, with the latter two carrying the 'pasha' title).\n\n&gt; You're right. I am back-pedaling some. I didn't mean to imply that the Ottomans were micro-managers who dictated every aspect of the lives of everyone throughout their empire.\n\nNo worries, this is just Reddit banter where things can be clarified later.  \n\n&gt;But there were numerous atrocities committed by the Sultan's armies against rebelling Arab tribes and some very inventive torture devices used against captured coup plotters over the centuries.\n \nOh I have no doubt about that, but that was probably not confined to Arabs.  The Jelali revolts I have mentioned were finally suppressed by a guy known as Murad Pasha the well-digger.  Why?  Here's a hint:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuyucu_Murad_Pasha\n\nI don't mean to imply that the Ottomans were especially brutal and ruthless (and neither do you, I assume) but they certainly could be heavy-handed even against ethnic Turks.  That said somehow they lasted a long time with (compared to elsewhere) minimal internal strife up till the 19th century if you ingore the Jelali Revolts.  They were not multi-cultural in the manner we understand today but understanding the way their particular brand of multi-culturalism worked and failed might provide clues for today's problems also.  \n\n&gt; And yes, North Africa is not the Middle East but it is/was populated by Arabs. And these Arabs did not like being dictated to by Turks for hundreds of years. That was my point.\n\nI understand.  I'd say it is just the North African fringe of the empire and that the present hot region in the Middle East was stable for its time under the Ottomans up till their dissolution period.  This is not to say something like the Ottoman rule would work now[1] but just that a proper understanding of the history of the region might be worthwhile.  \n\n[1] Since you seem to be interested in such stuff, perhaps you'd enjoy the absurdity in this bit of nutty prose:  http://www.israelshamir.com/English/Ottomans.htm\n", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "ups": 2, "name": "t1_c02aeab", "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5yrfi", "retrieved_on": 1427425878, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02aeab", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02ae7b", "body": "I am using the term 'Ottoman' and 'Turk' more-or-less interchangeably when referring to individuals of Anatolian extraction who were representatives of the sultan's government.

'Ottoman' is not an ethnicity in the sense we understand it.  The Ottoman-Turk locution you have used is inaccurate in that regard.  It isn't altogether clear that the ruling classes, Muslim or not, saw Turkishness in a positive light:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Turkism#Within_the_Ottoman_Empire\n\n&gt;Just one small area, the Maghrib of North Africa, during the 1700s there were so many coups and coup attempts by ethnic Moors and half-Turkish Moors against the sultan's regents in Tripoli, Algiers and Tunis that nobody has been able to agree on the number.\n\nThat is not the Middle East.  It is questionable if there ever was solid Ottoman rule in that area of Africa (comparable to, say, Western Thrace).\n\n&gt;The notion that the Ottomans saw Turks, Arabs, Armenians, as one indivisible, undifferentiated Dar al-Islam doesn't live up to scrutiny.\n\nI'm unsure what you mean here.  Armenians were a seperate \"millet\" and non-Muslim.  They were, up till the 19th century and especially the 1877-78 Russo-Ottoman war, seen as 'Millet-i Sadika' (the loyal millet) but that has nothing to do with Islam or Armenians belonging to an indivisible whole really.   \n\nBoth the multi-ethnic structure and the multi-cultural approach of the Ottomans (and their disintegration with rising nationalism) are complicated subjects that are not, IMHO, properly understood.  I most certainly am no expert, and you do seem to know quite a bit.

And lots of companies with big GOP connections, don't like the high price of oil.  Mainly because it increases their shipping and transport costs and thus raises their prices, and lowers their profits. \n\nBig Retail - Walmart, Kmart-Sears, Target, Macys, Costco, etc. would be able to lower prices and sell more, and be more profitable, if oil prices came down.  Fedex and UPS could spend less on gas, and make more profit on each Amazon.com order they deliver.   And then the major airlines have had problems because of the high prices of Jet Fuel.  I could go on and on about these large GOP controlled companies that would be doing a lot better if the price of Oil was half of what it now is at. \n\nAnd we aren't even getting into the large manufacturing companies that would be better off for lower oil prices -- Big Three Auto, the big Beer companies, Proctor and Gamble, even companies like M&amp;M Mars, Kellogg, etc. \n\nAlso, we have spent about **$2 Trillion dollars** on the war so far.   All the nice profits the oil companies have racked in are way less than that.    Why not just get Bush and the then GOP controlled Congress to pass a law giving them large Dollar Lotto Winnings?  It would have been a lot cheaper for the government, and the companies would have ended up with more cash in that case. \n\nThis is something that is much, much more pure stupidity.

We do this knowing hundreds of thousands of Iraqis will die.  And they do.\n\nThen we trick Saddam Hussein into attacking Kuwait (we tell him we won't care, and this comes right on the heels of our illegal invasion of Panama).  We do this to create a pretext for establishing a stronger presence in the region.  We do this knowing that the war we wage to drive the Iraqis out of Kuwait will consume hundreds of thousands of Iraqi lives.  And it does.\n\nWe invent the fairy-tale of Iraqi pursuit of WMD.  We use this to justify the most brutal sanctions ever imposed on another nation.  We impose these sanctions knowing that hundreds of thousands of Iraqis will die as a result.  And they do, and they are mostly children.\n\nUsing the same fairy-tale of Iraqi WMD, we invade anew.  Again, we do this knowing full well that we will end up killing hundreds of thousands of Iraqis in the process.  It looks like we're now over a million, and still we refuse to get out.  Still we refuse to stop killing Iraqis.\n\nOur weapons will continue to kill longer after we're gone.  We know that depleted uranium is a misnomer, that it is only partially depleted, that it is still radioactive, that the fine-grain particles are easily spreads by wind and inhaled/ingested into the body, where even low-levels of radiation can play havoc with human physiology.  We know that people will continue to die from the use of these weapons long after we're gone.  And yet we use them anyway.\n\nInto this incredible misery we've created for the Iraqi people, we compound the suffering by introducing heroin we recently \"liberated\" from Afghanistan, knowing that it will continue to ravage the society, that people in such agony will welcome the relief, albeit temporary, that such a drug can bring.\n\nWhen you look at it all in aggregate, the conclusion is unmistakable.  We are destroying the Iraqi people.
