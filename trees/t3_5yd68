The lenovo has a far better keyboard, with a more tactile feel and decent key travel. It's painful for me to touch-type on a mac keyboard - to be fair, I love my old IBM model M.\n\n2) Lack of a trackpoint. The Lenovo has a trackpoint right below/between the g and h keys. I never have to move my hands to move the mouse, which helps a lot.\n\n3) Mouse buttons. The lenovo has a left AND right mouse button. And even better, they're located right below the space bar. I hate moving my hands when I'm programming, so I have everything right there. If I need to move the mouse, I twitch my index finger over. If I need to click or right click on something, I move the appropriate thumb down a few milimeters, and click the button.\n\nThe macbookpro is a beautiful machine handicapped by its input devices.
