People have managed to segregate  (and de-segregate) themselves pretty well despite the best efforts of social planners like yourself.  Do I not have the right to associate with whomever I choose?\n\nAs a totally anecdotal example, I found myself in a suburban sports bar a few weeks ago where I observed about about half of the booths and tables had blacks and whites (and others) naturally socializing together -- all comfortable middle-classyish-like.

Let them come around on the rest in their own time.\n\nPeople who react to the CIA-thing with incredulity usually do not know that there are over 40 intelligence agencies in the federal government and that the CIA has been implicated in a number of unconscionable activities over the years.  The Company's misbehavior might have been tolerable in the height of the cold war but its culture and institutional composition seem out of place today and more likely to cause us trouble than save us from it.\n\nWe need to have a much more open government that is smaller and more accountable to the people.  A large, secretive agency with massive budgets, institutionalized paranoia and a history of illegal and destablizing activity worldwide, has a corrosive effect on our Republic.\n\nRon is right to want to shut it down.
