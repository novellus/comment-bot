It can not \"melt down\". It can't be turned into a bomb. And when it is switched off, you can crawl inside the reactor vessel in your shirt sleeves with no problems.\n\nThis Polywell (\"Many electron Wells\") fusion reactor will utterly change the entire world before 2025. All existing coal and oil fired power stations can be qucikly and easily converted to run on banks of \"plug-in\" fusion reactors.\n\nThis technology makes the moon utterly and completely unnecessary.\n\nAlthough we may still discover a very good use for Helium 3, which would encourage the development of moon bases.
