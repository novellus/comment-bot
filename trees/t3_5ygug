I was born in '85, and I'm pretty sure I didn't.  But those weren't really institutions, were they?\n\nI think you're confusing existing political and social institutions with new organizations that aren't quite well-established enough to be considered institutions.  Look at the [dictionary definition of the word](http://www.answers.com/institution?cat=biz-fin&amp;gwp=13). The Gestapo and KGB weren't extremely long-lived considering the existence of much older government agencies.  Governments try out and close agencies all the time.\n\nThe Constitution is certainly more well-established than the current government, and their hand in subverting it certainly makes them nihilistic.  They're operating on eroding the Constitution, which has been around in some form since the 18th century.\n\nLibertarians are operating on the other side of things: they think 'the good old days' were better before The New Deal and pretty much everything we've built since the end of the civil war.  So in other words, they favor destroying newer ideas over older ideas.  But don't confuse things: both of them want to erode or destroy _years_ of progress.  \n\nBoth Libertarians and those currently in charge share an extremely liberal disregard for legal precedent.  Libertarians disregard precedent set after the civil war, and those currently in power disregard precedent that isn't their own.  \n\n_Both parties want to take actions that would destroy the previously established status quo._  The reason they seem so different is that only one of them is currently capable of executing their nihilism.  The dollar's plummeting value allows us to measure the Bush administration's success in achieving its agenda.\n\nNihilism isn't necessarily always a bad thing.  There's another guy who said this better than I could:\n\n\"I praise, I do not reproach, [nihilism's] arrival. I believe it is one of the greatest crises, a moment of the deepest self-reflection of humanity. Whether man recovers from it, whether he becomes master of this crisis, is a question of his strength!\" \u2013 Friedrich Nietzsche\n\nBeing able to adapt change without destroying existing institutions is extremely difficult.  Frustration and narrow-minded perspectives lead to nihilism, and it is rarely the best solution unless people have been led astray to their ultimate detriment for generations. Revolution is nihilism.  Being comfortable with the term's implications and their bearing on us has relevance that isn't only political.\n\nTo answer your question: \"Who is not a nihilist?\"\n\nA person who is not a nihilist is a person who believes that the status quo is worthy of redemption by some means.  When this person believes that extreme measures need to be taken, they are not destructive: they work within the existing system.  An extreme person of this persuasion is traditionally referred to as a [radical](http://www.answers.com/topic/radical-govt-in-encyclopedia), although you might notice that some people don't distinguish between the traditional definition and one of general extremism.\n\nI don't know what you'd call someone who isn't a nihilist and isn't a radical.  That's highly contextual!  In today's day and age, those currently in power are irrational nihilists whose runaway spending will destroy and is destroying our economy for the middle and lower class.  It will take rational radicals to untangle us from the Neo-Con mess.  After the Bush administration's gaffes have been reversed, a person who was a rational radical during the repair process would revert to being a normal rational person.\n\nSo I suppose by that definition, rational people and radicals of all kinds (as many are still irrational) would not be considered nihilists.  That casts a relatively broad net. \n\nedit: Oh yeah. Moderates.
