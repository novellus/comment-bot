The general trend of Ron Paul submissions is that they make it to the front page.  I thought if I came up with a snappy enough headline I would at least entice people to click the link.\n\nWhat is likely going to happen is that this will get precisely two down votes (as just about everything I post to reddit does) and die without much fan fare.\n\nIf this has enraged any Ron Paul supporters, I'm quite sorry.  I assure you that I have nothing against the man or his politics.  I, in fact, don't know anything about the man other than he may at some point have read the Constitution of the United States of America.\n\nHappy redditing!\n\n**Edit**: At the time I am entering this comment this page had fallen to rank 46 in the \"New\" list.  45 and 47 were also Ron Paul stories.
