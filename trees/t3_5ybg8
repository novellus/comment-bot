And that it has 4 points, which is positively phenomenal in gaming.reddit terms?\n\n\"Hack-n-slash games are few and far between so I always get excited when a new one comes out.\"\n\nI'm curious as to his definition of \"few and far between\". We aren't talking point and click adventure games here. Especially if the only other hack and slash game he is going to mention is the positively archaic Diablo 2.\n\nDiablo 2 is a seven year old game, six if you take into account the expansion.\n\nIf you're reading this, review author/reddit submitter (possibly the same person), you should give these a bash (and maybe, you know, don't start a review with a first sentence that shows up a lack of gaming knowledge, or that maybe you are a Diablo fanboy) :\n\nTwo Worlds (2007), Silverfall (2007), Dawn of Magic (2007), Titan Quest (2006),  Dungeon Lords (2005), Dungeon Siege 2 (2005), Sacred (2004), Kult : Heretic Kingdoms (2004), Divine Divinity (2002). \n\nTitan Quest had an expansion this year, Sacred last year, and I think DS2 has as has one as well.\n\nHeck, if we aren't limited to PC then there is the multi-format Dark Alliance 2, Champions of Norrath and it's sequel on PS2, Dungeons and Dragons Heroes on Xbox.\n\nAll of these are since Diablo 2. \n\n(I'm half trying to offer advice, half being a total wanker. Also, before you get tricked by the semi decent demo, the Dungeon Lords entry was a joke. It's an abortion of a game, even if you make the mistake of waiting until the re-released for a price proper 'patched' version that masquerades as the collectors edition. Just say no, kids.)
