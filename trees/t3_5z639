Gore is a classic elitist, I can't imagine that he would ever \"lower\" himself to our level.  His entire life has centered around the presumption that he knows how to manage every body else's resources better than they do, and that he should be entitled to use force to do it.  Someone like that could never lower himself to such a level without being so fake that it would be humiliating for all involved.\n\nAlso, it is truly pathetic to try focus on the coal miners for consumption choices of millions and millions of people.  It's sort of like trying to hold the knife makers accountable, instead of individuals who stab people.  It doesn't make sense if you are truly struggling to change the world, but makes a huge amount of sense if you are trying to manipulate energy markets for personal and political gain. \n", "subreddit": "politics", "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_5z639", "name": "t1_c02bhrc", "author_flair_css_class": null}
