It's not your fault that your teachers did not teach you about African civilizations.  The idea of Africans being totally primitive people until the arrival of the Europeans has been proven false.

And 1000 years ago, believe it or not, Western Africa was actually more developed and better educated than Western Europe.  The example of Dark Age  Europe proves that \"shit happens\".  Europe was the equivalent of modern Africa during those times, as a land of uncivilized and dumb savages compared to their more civilized Islamic, African, and Asian counterparts.  But look at where Europe is.  \n\nAnd for those of you who are true believers in the IQ test, keep in mind that Asians score more.
