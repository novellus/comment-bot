Clearly there was a huge disconnect or isolating episode that must have transpired in order for Native Americans to universally manifest a set of mDNA that dates back 30k years before it has anything in common with East Asians.  The question is not when or how Native Americans crossed over to the New World, but rather, has to do with why they represent a distinct mDNA lineage that apparently antedates New World colonization by 15k years.
