Of course, that's why the US still has the FRA (Federal Railroad Administration), to make sure passanger railroad cars are built to safe standards.\n\nThe same is true to a lesser extent in a bus.  Though they are not nearly as massive as a train, they are are still more massive than most cars, so if they hit one, the passengers will simply be jostled whereas the people in the car will be severely impacted.

Here's why parachutes for airline passengers is a silly idea:\r\n\r\nEveryone who jumps out of an airplane does so voluntarily after extensive training. The airplane they jump out of is in under full control in stable, slow, level flight. It has either has been designed to allow people to jump out of it in flight (military airplanes), or has been modified to allow skydivers to leap out (the outward opening door has been removed).\r\n\r\nThere have been many cases where planeloads of skydivers have crashed killing everyone on board. Why didn't they simply jump out of the crashing plane? They couldn't, because the plane was out of control, and they were pinned to the walls or ceiling by the voilent tumbling of the airplane.\r\n\r\nAirliners are pressurized to about 8psi. Every door plugs a big hole in an otherwise perfect pressure vessel. The doors sit in special fittings which can withstand the internal pressure load which is around 20,000 lbs outward. All airliner doors have to move inwards first to clear the fittings before they can be fully opened. So it is impossible to open the door unless the airplane is de-pressurized. Do that at 35,000 feet and everyone will be unconscious in a few seconds, so the airplane has to be at low altitude. Even then, outward opening doors could not be opened into the airstream. (A few exceptions have inward-and-upward opening doors.)\r\n\r\nForgetting the door issue for a moment, any airliner which is under sufficient control in slow flight and at low altitude to allow hundreds of untrained people to leap out is clearly an airplane which is in no danger. Even the ill-fated JAL 747 mentioned in the article was barely flying, wallowing around the sky with its vertical tail gone and the pilots struggling to maintain control.\r\n\r\nThe worst scenario facing any airliner in flight is an internal fire, a situation where opening the doors would only make the situation much worse.\r\n\r\nEven if your airplane has lost all engine power (the Air Transat Azores incident, the Air Canada Gimli incident, the British Airways Jakarta incident), your best bet is to stay with the airplane, not leap out. No one died in any of thoses incidents. Even a controlled crash is much more survivable than a blind leap into nothing.\r\n\r\nIt all boils down to this: If the airplane is out of control, parachutes are useless; if it is under control, they are not needed.\r\n\r\n", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5yqin", "id": "c02aadp", "author_flair_css_class": null}

Neither was there a fire, since the airplane kept taxiing, and promptly departed.\n\n&gt; Answer: It sounds to me as if the El Al captain was retiring. Often, when a crew member is making his or her final flight, the fire department comes out and sprays the airplane with water -- much the way firefighting boats spray incoming ships during special events.\n\nThat's awesome. I guess when I retire, they'll hose down my rack servers with thousands of gallons of water too?\n\nActually, now that I think about it, that'd be a great way to retire.
