Excuse me if I go on, but I don't think this issue may be briefly summed up.  \nCanada, being usually the most relevant comparison, has much in common with the United States, but a great underlying difference arises from its origin in 18th century conservatism, which sought to stick with an imperfect and arguably nonsensical but nevertheless functional status quo (implying [Toryism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory) in its own context) rather than enlightenment revolutionary ideals, which instead sought to found a new order lacking the older one's flaws.  The result is that a basic presumption which precedes discussion on progress and change in a Canadian (or, indeed, British) political context is that the fundamental historical precedents on which society is built are relatively likely to be *flawed* or even *meaningless* in principle, in any given case, but have been and will often continue to be tolerated as long as they are *functional* in practice.  The Canadian system, unlike the American, which presumes itself rationally justified in its foundation, is conservative in that it tends to take for granted that precedent is preserved until such a time as it has been demonstrated to be dysfunctional in practice (this has [happened occasionally](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King-Byng_Affair)).  \nThe bizarre result, in the present, is that two nations with barely distinguishable cultures respond very differently to a change such as the recognition of gay marriage.  It is comparatively easy for the Canadian system to acknowledge that something within standing legal precedent is in practice dysfunctional or nonsensical, as the system doesn't claim to be founded on reason, but rather merely tradition.  The American system, by strangely contradictory nature, appears resistant to the reason of the present as a consequence of the conviction that it is founded on the reason and rational foundations of the past.    The Canadian system is built upon absurdities, its founding fathers [barely distinguishable from an organised crime syndicate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Compact).  And yet, I think these facts compel Canadians to live in the present, and make the most of the present without obsessing over the values of the past, as a consequence.  The \"founding fathers\", any founders anywhere, were no cleverer than the theorists of the present and their intentions no more pure.  It's true that much of the American problem has to do with religionism in the political sphere.  But I think it also proceeds from the fact that Americans have made a religion of their politics, worshiping their forebears and obsessing over the ideas they laid out when living a little more in the present century might help put things in a saner perspective.
