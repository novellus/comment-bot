From [their mission statement](http://www.energywatchgroup.org/Mission.11+M5d637b1e38d.0.html):\n\nEnergy policy needs objective information\n\nThe Energy power industry and Government organisations keep up the belief of the unlimited availability of cheap energy from conventional sources. But energy policy needs objective information.\n\nFor this reason the Energy Watch Group was founded due to the initiative of the German parliamentarian Hans-Josef Fell and further parliamentarians from other countries. It is supported by the Ludwig-B\u00f6lkow-Foundation. In this project scientists are working on studies independently of Government and company interests concerning\n\n-    the shortage of fossil and atomic energy\n     resources,\n-    development scenarios for regenerative energy\n     sources as well as\n-    strategies deriving from these for a long-term\n     secure energy supply at affordable prices.\n\nThe scientists are therefore collecting and analysing not only ecological but above all economical and technological connections. The results of these studies are to be presented not only to experts but also to the politically interested public.   ", "author_flair_css_class": null}
