Personally, I don't like it, because it means I have to put more effort into reading code that uses this feature.

But here goes for the Python side:\n\n* Much better REPLs than in Ruby. Ruby has `irb` (note to ruby guys: if there's anything really better than irb, please tell me) which is a piece of dung. Python's base repl (`python`) is leaps and bounds beyond that, and it stacks first-party `IDLE` (graphical REPL) and third-party `ipython` (console) on top of it.\n\n* Much better documentation all around, on any platform. No only in Python itself, but from my experience python modules also have a much better doc, not just an rdoc dump.\n\n* More third-party modules, often more mature, especially in specialized high-perf areas (PIL for image processing, PyGame for games, numpy/scipy for scientific or big mathematical stuff)\n\n* Mature community full of long timer users (as opposed to people who were brought to Ruby via rails 2 years ago or less, not that it's bad but \"old timers\" provide insight gotten through long years of experience)\n\n* Maybe it sounds stupid, but I also think Python's module system is *much* better than ruby: in python, if I `import foo` it creates an object called `foo` that materializes the module in my namespace, and everything that is in the `foo` module is now accessible in that `foo` namespace. In Ruby, `require \"foo\"` reads the foo.rb file and then *dumps everything in my current namespace*. And if you don't know what was inside, you're hosed. I hate that.\n\n* The Zen of Python in general, and \"There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it\" in particular\n\nGreat books in Python, I usually tell people to start with the Python Turorial, and then jump to Dive into Python. You don't need books to get started in Python.\n\nThe advantages of Ruby over Python:\n\n* `gem`. Python has `easy_install`, but it's nowhere near as good, nowhere near as streamlined, and nowhere as obvious to use.\n\n* The pervasive use of blocks give library creators a very high flexibility, an ability to create behaviors in ways that are much clunkier in Python (and Python has to add syntax to make that better, see the `with` statement from 2.5)\n\n* Linked to the previous point, the pervasiveness of a functional style of programming which I quite dig.\n\n* Slightly better metaprogramming support, especially for \"simple\" metaprogramming (generating methods on the fly), that's both a blessing (you can create lots of cool stuff that works through black magic invocations) and a curse (other people can do it too)\n\n* Implicit self. Yeah I know the reasoning about Python's explicit self, but I'd still like it to be implicit.\n\nBut really, what I'd suggest you to do is: try each one for a day or two, then go for the one that \"sticks\".

Specifically, the details of the garbage collector prevent fork()ed processes from consuming less memory than two processes started separately.  Rails uses quite a bit of memory, so the ability to save some by forking would be very nice.  I hope Ruby 1.9 or Rubinius will soon solve this problem (not sure if Ruby 1.9 does; Rubinius definitely does but does not support all of Ruby at this time).", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "programming", "name": "t1_c02a72r", "parent_id": "t1_c02a5zy", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2fwo", "ups": 0, "name": "t1_c02a5zy", "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5yp0s", "retrieved_on": 1427425986, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02a5zy", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5yp0s", "body": "My take on python/ruby:\n\nRuby is a better language, better structure, designed mostly correctly from the ground up, good syntax.\n\nPython is a better development tool because there's lots and lots of useful code out there for it.  This might change as ruby uses it's recent popularity to \"catch up\".  If I need to write an application using one of these 2 languages, chances of finding good resources to work from are much more likely in python than in ruby.\n\nRuby (currently) is good and useful for rails, and that's it.
