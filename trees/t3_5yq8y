With it, founding principles of the U.S. Constitution were discarded in the name of fighting terror. The Act made it lawful to hold prisoners indefinitely without charge or trial, to assume guilt before innocence, to blur the definition of torture, and to use information obtained through brutal treatment as \u201cevidence.\u201d Other governments, including the British during America\u2019s founding, have tried to exert control in similar ways. It didn\u2019t work then and it doesn\u2019t work now.\n\nIs America safer when we undo the Constitution? Those with first-hand experience of torture, such as Senator John McCain, believe it is not only wrong but counter-productive. This and other abuses erode America\u2019s moral standing in the world. Strong evidence suggests that they even serve as a recruiting tool for those using terror and provide convenient cover for anyone else abusing human rights.\n\nMaking the world a safer place requires consistent and universal respect for human rights. Join Amnesty International in insisting that Congress return America to its core constitutional principles of justice by overturning the Military Commissions Act, granting fair and timely trials, treating detainees humanely and reinstating habeas corpus \u2013 the right to challenge one\u2019s detention in court.\n\nStrengthen America\u2019s commitment to human rights and the rule of law. It\u2019s up to people like us to demand it.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
