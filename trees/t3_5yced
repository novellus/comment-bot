Note that I've had much larger shocks than the phone wires can give you, without harm.   For most people the phone line cannot kill them, but there are exceptions.   (Of course if lightning strikes the phone line all bets are off)\r\n\r\n&gt;Do phone lines carry up to 70 volts?\r\n\r\nIIRC it is 90 volts on ring.\r\n\r\n&gt; And could using appliances that require more current than normal phones possibly create a scenario that heats phone wires up to create a fire?\r\n\r\nNo.   V=IR applies, R is high because the wires are long and small, while V isn't very large.   So the total power you can get isn't very high.   (Of course you can create a fire in your device connected to the phone lines)\r\n\r\n&gt;A novice in electronics would like to know more.\r\n\r\nDon't waste your time.   While there are a lot of INTERESTING things you could do with the power from the phone lines, there isn't enough power there to do anything USEFUL.\r\n", "author": "bluGill", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c029bs8", "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "name": "t1_c029bs8", "parent_id": "t1_c029bj1", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "name": "t1_c029bj1", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 1, "link_id": "t3_5yced", "retrieved_on": 1427426381, "body": "Does anyone know how, if this might be potentially dangerous?
