Rowling doesn't tell seven individual stories, though each book has its own plot: she's constantly developing her world, introducing characters, and playing with themes in a way that really ties together at the end. The climax of the seventh book (the last 200 pages or so) is without a doubt the most intense set of scenes I've ever read in a book, with few pauses throughout it. The reason isn't because Rowling packs every word she writes with utter power and multiple meanings. It's because she's writing using characters that have been around for thousands of pages, literally a decade and a half of writing, and we've seen them grow up, and we see them all come together for one grand climax. It's overwhelmingly brilliant, though not in a classic literary sense.\n\nThe other thing I like about Rowling (and my other favorite writers for that matter) is that they build their worlds off of reality, in a way.

Now no one is allowed to alter or repurpose art.\n\nThat's bizarre reasoning. My argument is that text should not be viewed as the hallowed domain of it's author - in essence, that it should not be utterly and totally controlled by a single person. That is a far bigger limit on its \"freedom\" than viewing it as autonomous.\n\nAnd of course people are \"allowed\" to alter text - most popular texts are published in a number of different editions, translations etc. but each publication remains autonomous, a cohesive self-contained text.\n\n&gt;I propose instead that, while the creator is alive and while the body of work in question is growing or changing at sufficient rate to constitute a \"living body of work,\" that the creator's assertions regarding canon should be honored.\n\n***I don't give a damn what the author decides a text means***. If I watch a political debate, and a candidate says \"I support $POLICY\", and then two weeks later says \"Well, what I actually meant was, I don't support $POLICY\", the meaning of the words said in the debate do not magically alter. *It is no longer the domain of the speaker* to inform me what the words meant. If they wanted complete, timeless creative control over the thought, they should have left it drifting around in their mind.\n\nNow, that's not to say that sometimes an author's opinion isn't useful as something *to consider* - e.g. Rowling's comments might be useful insofar as they might prompt a reader to analyse the text with a view to Dumbledore being gay, and if the text bears that reading, then so be it - but if it doesnt, Rowling is simply speculating. Anyone can speculate.\n\nIf Rowling told us that Harry Potter was actually a robot, would he become a robot in the published texts? No, he would not.

The author may even write a lot of that down, because even if those details don't make it into the story, they're still important to maintain so that the story is internally consistent.\n\nFor example, Tolkien kept copious notes about just about *everything* having to do with Middle-Earth - so much so that his son has been able to publish many more volumes based almost entirely on those notes. Whether or not they ever got published though should be irrelevant to the fact that these were the \"truths\" about the universe that LOTR was set in.\n\nTo get back to HP - J.K. Rowling never (to my knowledge) explicitly states in the novels that gravity exists in the potterverse, for example. Yet that's inarguably a part of the fictional reality - the characters specifically need magical spells in order to counteract this unmentioned force.\n\nSo there's an unwritten assumption, \"Gravity Exists\", that the story is written around. It'd be foolish to assume that it doesn't exist in the Potterverse, despite not being mentioned in the text.\n\nSo we have the case with Dumbledore.

He was not portrayed with any kind of sexual orientation at all. \n\nSo he's not gay. He's not straight. He's a fictional character. Sure, he can be read as gay or straight by readers who are interested in interpreting his sexual orientation. But I feel strongly that no one, not even the author, can simply declare what he is or isn't outside of the text.\n\nWhy? Because where does it end if Rowling has the authority to declare anything she wants now that all seven books are published? Can she tell us that the entire series was an absurd, egocentric fantasy from the deranged mind of a young boy locked in an insane asylum because his mother didn't love him? Can she tell us that Ron and Harry experimented with each other sexually during their sixth year (even if that _would_ explain the silly tension between them in the seventh book)?\n\nI know I might sound pedantic, but this really matters. An author's right to insert material into their novel ends when they put down their pen and put the story into their reader's hands. \n\nOr to put it in more simple terms: Han shot first. Han will _always_ shoot first. And if Rowling does not write another Potter book that clarifies the issue, Dumbledore's sexual orientation will always be open to reader interpretation.
