It's obviously a bad idea to use the kids as a punching bag for your own problems, but isn't it reasonable for them to know that your moods change with the circumstance, and there's a whole serious life that you're taking care of for them?

Again, depending on the definition of 'fight', sounds a bit absolutist to me.  Some of us consider arguments can be completely healthy.  My wife's family *never* discuss anything that is contentious - I find it dysfunctional and unproductive and I don't think it's coincidental that my in-laws have some very offensive and illogical views.
