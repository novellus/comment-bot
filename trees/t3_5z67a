In particular, I find the labeling of the Iranian National Guard as a terrorist organization to be particularly troubling. I have no desire to see another country develop nuclear weapons, including Iran. However, I feel the saber-rattling the United States is conducting damages our reputation amongst our allies, and makes it difficult to bring troublesome regimes to the table for constructive diplomacy.\n\n The United States is the richest, most powerful country in the world. It is our responsibility to lead by example and set the tone for international relations. We must act as we wish other countries to act. As Theodore Roosevelt stated, in diplomacy it is best for us to: \"speak softly and carry a big stick\".\n\n Our current churlish diplomatic strategies are squandering what little goodwill we have left within the international community. As an example, our recent threats towards Iran have greatly strained U.S./Russian relations. Moreover, our actions will likely increase anti-U.S. sentiment amongst Iranians, a people well known for their western-leaning disposition. Our behavior is unnecessary, and does not become us as a nation.\n\n I implore you to use what ever power is in your means to draw us away from this diplomatic debacle.\n\n Thank you for your time.\n\nSincerely,\n\n---", "author": "fangolo", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c02bggw", "parent_id": "t3_5z67a", "id": "c02bggw", "author_flair_css_class": null}
