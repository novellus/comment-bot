Abstractly, you just move changesets around.  Although it's all in the same path, there's a good distinction between working directory and repository.  You can set your working directory to any version you want any time you want to.\n\nLikewise, a push or pull can very likely produce multiple heads.  Each head is a direction the code is growing from a particular changeset.  Any changeset you make can be a child of any other state your project has been in.\n\nA merge operation makes one head out of two.  This is where you end one of your growth directions and state that as of the change you're creating, both are now available.

Branching occurs by just copying the directory to a new one (which is a bit unhelpful if you have other files in there, but great overall) so if your branch sucks it doesn't remain forever in your history, you just delete it.
