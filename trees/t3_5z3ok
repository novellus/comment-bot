That's why I made my comment. Here are the three obvious possibilities that I came up with:\n\n1. curlytree was just trying to start a discussion, and wanted people to reply directly to him. That's kind of a bogus reason to make the comment, since reddit's features naturally afford a discussion for every story.\n\n2. curlytree hadn't actually read the article to the end. Maybe he read halfway and then decided that it was a good article (I think it is, for the record), and that he should submit it *right away*. I believe that this hasty attitude - skimming vs. reading, posting quick-hit articles (e.g. linkjacked pics), and submitting before reading the entire article - is at least partially responsible for the decline in reddit's quality.\n\n3. curlytree thought that the title of the article (which was used as the reddit title) wasn't explicit enough, and wanted to rephrase it.\n\nI didn't think any of these reasons were of sufficient quality to justify me *not* opening a very tiny can of e-whoop-ass.
