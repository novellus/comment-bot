However, words I find are such poor servants of the truth, nonetheless, I will clumsily employ them. I don't believe God exists, I **know** God exists. You believe God exists. That's an incredibly weak position for you to take (with all due respect now, IMO). But I must give something up in order to make my claim make sense. I **know** God exists, for I **know** that something exists beyond my consciousness, and I **know** that there is no pivotal seat to my consciousness, so if my consciousness is the result of a distributed function of all that I am, there is no room for my consciousness to make up the *other*, because it is the *other*. However, that being said, I am admittedly reluctant to **believe** that some smelly camel-riding folk 2000 years, who, when you stand back and consider them in their entirety, seemed less than scrupulous in their willingness to mix politics with their stated faith, had anything to say about this God, whom I **know** to exist, that I would be willing to believe. \n\nI see, you would like your smelly, 2000 yo, camel-riders to have the final word on something to which I have immediate and direct access. \n\nLOL. But don't get me wrong. I appreciate your quaint traditions, superstitions, and cult rituals. I on the other hand am an evolved being, who deals solely with the source of light which exists within all of us, within our own minds, no middle-man required. But I appreciate your little games and shit, puttin on the tie and going to church, ada dada da. \n\nHehehehe, I apologise. \n\nHey, have you ever noticed how we always kill the good guys, and leave the demons to run amok on the planet.

The fires (I'm in San Diego), cancer scare right now with a loved one, full time school load and when I don't have part time work I need to look for it...  So, when I come to Reddit it's a bit of mental escape for me, but it hasn't been too enjoyable of late largely cause Reddiquette is almost extinct.  Every now and then there are funny comments and informative exchanges, but mostly it's a disappointment.  \r\n\r\nAs for math, I didn't go beyond calculus.  I got an A in that but I don't think I understood a thing really.  I may take up a serious study of math again on my own, but right now I should be reading a few thousand pages a week. I shouldn't lash out at sophomoric atheists, I've been there myself at times (emotional reasons, not intellectual ones).  Belief in God is not irrational.  Plenty of fine philosophers arrived at God through perfectly logical steps from axioms that most people admit are at least plausible.  The god of philosophers isn't God though, it's a man made abstraction that subsitutes one puzzle with another.  God is a sacred mystery and God transcends reason and the human mind.  We as finite beings can't comprehend or know God, but that proposition is distinct from faith.  \r\n\r\nWell, it's 3 AM and I've only had a couple hours of sleep in the last two days.  Sorry again to you and flukes1.  It's just sad to see people refusing to go beyond their complacent smugness about the question of God.  The greatest minds in human history did not identify themselves as atheists for many good reasons.  When someone suggests only atheists are ration they reveal their own ignorance of logic and math and philosophy.  Euclid wasn't an atheist.  Socrates wasn't an atheist.  Frankly, you kind of have to scrape the bottom of the barrel to find intellectual figures who would call themselves such a thing. It's anti-intellectual and anti-philosophical and anti-human.  It's the position of a few guys named Dick who know Dick about a lot of subjects and it was the position of communists who fell for Marx's trash.  Most atheists of today are the terrorists of intellectual life.  Agnostics are open to evidence and argument and the vast range of human experience and history, but a guy likee Dawkins is so shallow and limited in focus.  Einstein got angry when people misquoted him as if he were an atheist and for good reason when you really reflect on the 20th century and where we are now.\r\n\r\n", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 4, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5zhpl", "retrieved_on": 1427424903, "id": "c02cc2z", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02cc2z", "parent_id": "t1_c02cbx1", "body": "You've yet to demonstrate to me that you even actually understand the theories or ideas of any of those guys.\n\nI sent you an email regarding a mathematical paradox for the ratio of whole numbers that produce an irrational result.

I am a catholic, and I consider myself very rational. I don't subject myself to  any teaching either religious, academic or political.

For example I do not condemn same-sex marriage, but I also am pro-life and cannot see the justification in the death of an innocent child simply for convenience. Although I may hold these views, I know they can be argued until everyone is blue in the face, and I can see the opinions supporting both sides. Theism is a belief, not fact. Facts are only so when proven, and God cannot be proven, but neither can many of the scientific theories of today. I understand the frustration when dealing with ignorant Bible thumpers (my grandmother being one of  them), but it is equally irritating when coming across apparently \"rational\" atheists , who do nothing more than than try to destroy the beliefs of religous peoples. This is why when I recite the Apostles Creed we a s Catholics say \"I believe in God\", not \"There is a God\". If people from either side  of the coin cannot diferentiate what is truth and what is belief, and begin to condemn, that is when we may as well ride gloriously back to the dark ages and close our minds.\n\nPS. All my best friends are atheists and yet we are able to co-exist without destroying anyones beliefs or straining our friendship, something that seems to be nonexistent in America. ( I am Canadian)\n\nPPS. Unless the use of words is in some sort of slang, it does not matter is posters misspell or use improper grammar. It is irrelevant outside of academic papers.
