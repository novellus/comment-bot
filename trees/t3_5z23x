Do you want to blow up Paliament?  Congress?  No?  Because if I was working on a rival campaign, that's what I'd try and sell.  'Ron Paul supporters glorify terrosists with fundraiser'.

Okay, so we have President Doctor Messiah Ron Paul.  What's he going to do?

Have expanded presidential powers worked for you over the last...oh...6 years or so?\n\n3) Following 2, why not spend your energy, money and time getting a congressman from your district elected who espouses your point of view?

If you're going to sell off your action figures on eBay to donate the money to a campaign, why not make it a worthwhile one?  Until the presidential vote is on the intrablogs, he's not going to win, place or show.\n\nI've made this offer before and I'll make it again.
