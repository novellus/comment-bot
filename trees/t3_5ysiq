Ayurveda also agrees with this principle. To regulate the living body easily, the acharyas concised the pancha bhootas into tridoshas (vata, pitta, kapha). These tridoshas are the basic pavement for all ayurvedic theories. Along with tridoshas, datusamjna, malasamjna are given to certain constituents for the functioning concept of living things. Datus and malas are controlled by doshas. Samyavastha (well-being) is the condition when the doshas are in their natural rhythm. When this rhythm is lost it is called vaishamya (disease). The former means order, the latter, disorder.\r\n\r\nDoshas cannot be identified separately in samyavastha. In diseased condition, the doshas manifest their particular symptoms. These symptoms denote malfunctioning of the doshas. The purpose of treatment of all diseases is to keep the doshas in equilibrium. In Ayurveda there are three steps in treating any diseases, they are samsodhana - cleansing process, samsamana - palliative measures and nidanaparivarjana - treating the causes.\r\n\r\nIn Kerala, certain special Panchakarma procedures are done for purification of the body. This is a model which shows the process of Sirodhara and Pizhichal, done together.\r\n\r\nSamsodhanam is considered a prominent process and should be administered with full care. Samsodhana is so important because the diseases treated by samsamana may occur again but those treated by the former will never recur or the chances of recurrance are very small.\r\n\r\nPanchakarma is a synonym for samsodhana. Panchakarma actually is a group of treatments, five in number, all of which are not commonly practised in all diseases. The panchakarma are vamana, virechana, snehavasti, kashayavasti and nasya. Vamana is emesis, virechana is purging, vasti is enema, which of two kinds done with medicated oils and medicated decoctions and are called snehavasti and kashayavasti respectively. Nasya is instillation of medicines through nose. Susrutha, the father of surgery, gives stress to rakthamoksha (blood-letting) as one of the panchakarma, taking the two kinds of vasti as a single karma.\r\n\r\nThere are certain steps to be followed before doing panchakarma called poorvakarmas. They are snehana (oleation) and swedana (sudation). Snehana has to be done by two ways, application of snehadravyas internally and externally. Swedana is classified into four types to promote sweat. The purpose of poorvakarma is to liquefy and guide the provoked doshas to the mainstream to facilitate the sodhana karma.\r\n\r\nThe process of letting out the vitiated blood is termed Rakthamoksha.This is an illustration of Lord Dhanwanthri holding a leech in the right hand whichis extensively used in blood letting.\r\n\r\nVamana (Emesis)\r\n\r\nThe first in panchasodhana karma, this process requires good attention and skilled assistance. It induces expulsion of the stomach contents through the mouth. Kapha or kapha dominant diseases are selected for this procedure. Diseases like severe skin diseases (psoriasis, urticaria) bronchial asthma, mental disorders and so on. This process is not suggested for pregnant women, the aged, those suffering from cardiac problems and those who are not very strong. On the previous day, the patient, who has undergone sneha sweda is given kapha increasing foods. The next morning, after ablutions and a hot water bath, the patient should be asked to sit in a relaxed manner in an armchair. Milk is commonly used for this purpose. For those with milk intolerance, sugarcane juice can be used. The patient has to drink as much as milk as he can. Then a paste of madana phala (10 gms) along with yashtimadhu powder (5 gms), vacha (5 gms), rock salt (5 gms) and honey (5 ml) mixed with milk should be given. Within a short time, the patient will feel nauseous and starts vomiting. All impure accumulated kapha will come out. Normally eight bouts are seen. The attenders should hold the patient's forehead and massage his back and wipe away the sweat. Vomiting is stopped when the pitta or yellow colouration is seen, which is considered the correct symptom. If the bouts are less, vomiting should be by irritating the uvula by touching with the figers or a quill. Then allow the patient to wash his face and fingers with hot water. Then dhoomapana - inhalation of medicated fumes - is done. The smoke should be inhaled through one nostil and exhaled through the mouth and the other nostril. This should be done thrice.\r\n\r\nCloser view of the image of Lord Dhanwantri depicting the leech.\r\n\r\nAfter this, certain steps have to be necessarily followed called paschat-karma. These are mainly food restrictions, called samsarjana kriya. Just after vamana, if the patient is hungry, thin gruel is given. After ascertaining the digestive power, thick gruel, porridge, porridge with meat soup are given. The entire treatment takes 15 days.\r\n\r\nVirechana (Purgation)\r\n\r\nPitta and pitta dominant diseases are cured by this process. By this the vitiated doshas are made to pass through the anus. Poorvakarma as noted in vamana are advocated here. Though several drugs are mentioned for virechana, trivrit is considered the best. Trivrit combinations, like avipathy churna, trivrileha are used. To give the medicine it should be ascertained whether the last meal has been digested. Medicine should be given after the kaphakala (about 9 a.m.) - 15 to 25 gms of Avipathy churna mixed with hot water. No food is given till virechana is over. In proper virechana, the patient passes urine, stool, pitta, medicine, kapha and vata in order. About 20 purges may be seen. This also depends on the patient's health.\r\n\r\nA mild form of virechana is an unavoidable factor in ayurvedic therapy. It is commonly used to treat various kinds of ailments in which poorvakarma is not necessary. So virechana is also used for prevention. The paschat karma followed is similar to that of vamana except that dhoomapana is not administered.\r\n\r\nVasti (Enema)", "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": "1192986635", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5ysiq", "id": "c02aetu", "author_flair_css_class": null}
