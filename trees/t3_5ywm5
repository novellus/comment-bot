OK, so we seem to in fact be agreeing that this aspect of the FreeBSD model is equivalent to a more open version of Linux where about an order of magnitude more people are helping to incorporate changes ;)\n\n2. The two sentences are independent.  The second sentence \"Contributors lose interest without immediate feedback from kernel maintainers and their trusted expert developers.\" describes the bottleneck from having a few overworked gatekeepers and does not relate to the slow release process.  The speed of releases is not correlated to the responsiveness and loss rate of submitted changes being committed to git for release at some arbitrary later date.\n\n3. Either you can think of some problems, or you can't.  You have gone from a position of claiming that FreeBSD *does not* scale to a neutral position where you make no claim.  You appear to have conceded this point.  However I would go further and say that there are lessons that can be learned from the experience of the FreeBSD project if you are willing to consider them.\n\n4. Not sure why this is relevant.  git was needed to solve a previous scaling problem (patch management) but doesn't have a bearing on what problems remain or how they might be overcome in the future.\n\n5. You can still have a chief architect if you want to, while at the same time opening up development to more people.  OTOH, FreeBSD used to have such a chief architect but we got rid of the position because we found it was not necessary and actually slowed down development by serializing too many things.", "author": "kkenn", "created_utc": "1193153806", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2fwo", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_c02at04", "id": "c02at5w", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2fwo", "ups": 2, "name": "t1_c02at04", "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5ywm5", "retrieved_on": 1427425688, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02at04", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02asvs", "body": "1.

His main role is as fork deterrent, keeping everyone working more or less on the same major version.
