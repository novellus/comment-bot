Obviously this is also possible with non-unique URLs but the process becomes more challenging.\n\nAs Simon Willison mentioned in my comments, having multiple URLs also breaks visited link functionality.\n\nThere are also a number of technical programming-related reasons why unique URLs are preferred but that's moving away from the domain of user experience.\n\nMy motivation for writing the article was that I was fed up with SEO being the justification behind almost every decision to do with the sites I work on, specifically URL design. Almost every character in some of our URLs is keyword fluff that exists purely for SEO purposes.

Delete the article title from the URL, and you get a list of articles.\n\n&gt; It's all articles on how to make your site more robot friendly.\n\nThis is simply untrue.\n\n* Readable URL Slugs &amp;mdash; about making slugs human-friendly, doesn't mention robots at all.\n* Question Concerning Django and Templates &amp;mdash; about the admin section for Django websites, something that will *never be seen  by a search engine bot*.\n* Undo Form Reset for kids who can\u2019t reset good &amp;mdash; about JavaScript to stop people accidentally hitting the rest button on forms, again nothing to do with bots.\n* Be Careful with jQuery &amp;mdash; about writing efficient JavaScript, once more, something bots don't look at.\n\nI don't get it.  You are blatantly lying about this guy.  Why?  Do you know him personally or something?\n\n&gt; URL's should be unique. That goes without saying.\n\nIt *should* go without saying, but duplicate URIs are very common and it needs to be pointed out in an article about URI structure.\n\nIn fact, duplicate URIs are a common black hat SEO technique.  Yet another example of him arguing *against* black hat SEO techniques.\n\n&gt; Making them where a user can hack them is nice, but that's not what he's doing.\n\nAside from the URI of the article in question, did you bother actually reading the article?  He says things like:\n\n&gt; &gt; The user must also be able to swap in alternative segment that make sense, like changing \u201c2007\u201d to \u201c2006\u201d\n\nYou don't think that's making URIs hackable?\n\n&gt; Imagine calling up someone on the phone and trying to read his url to them, and getting them to enter it correctly. Do you think they will be able to? I don't.\n\nI do.  It's long, but it's comprised of easily recognisable words.  Compared with common CMS approaches of generating long opaque strings of numbers and letters, it's a big improvement.\n\nFurthermore, you are focused on the URI of this particular article as your sole \"evidence\".  You can see clearly how he arrived at this URI, and the only downside is that it is verbose for articles with long titles.  Take a look at the same mechanism applied to some of his other articles:\n\nhttp://www.andrewingram.net/articles/readable_url_slugs/\n\nhttp://www.andrewingram.net/articles/be_careful_with_jquery/\n\nDo you think they are totally unfriendly for humans?  Really?\n\n&gt; Look at the URL's on any good application, like craigslist or youtube, and they break every suggesting that he's talking about.\n\nThose applications are not good because of their URI design, they are good *in spite* of their URI design.\n\n&gt; The only reason to make sure that you don't have two URL's pointing at the same content, is so your pagerank doesn't get cut in half.\n\nThis is not true.  For example:\n\n* Multiple links stop your browser history from working properly; links show up as unvisited if you read the article but at a different URI.\n* They slow things down and cost bandwidth; multiple URIs lower your cache hit ratio.\n* They stop duplicates from being detected on sites like Reddit.\n\nAs [the W3C puts it](http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#uri-aliases):\n\n&gt; &gt; The problem with aliases is that if half of the neighborhood points to one URI for a given resource, and the other half points to a second, different URI for that same resource, the neighborhood is divided. Not only is the aliased resource undervalued because of this split, the entire neighborhood of resources loses value because of the missing second-order relationships that should have existed among the referring resources by virtue of their references to the aliased resource.\n\n&gt; &gt; When a URI alias does become common currency, the URI owner should use protocol techniques such as server-side redirects to relate the two resources.\n\nDo you think the W3C are giving SEO advice here?\n\n&gt; This page gives what some may think is good SEO advice. It's nothing more than SEO advice\n\nI guess [the W3C are nothing but spammers](http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/metaDataInURI-31#convenientURIs), right?

Do you think they will be able to?  I don't.\n\nSo, the people who do this, can spend their time, searching for there keywords, and think it means something, but it's just lame, and it will get you no where.\n\nLook at the URL's on any good application, like craigslist or youtube, and they break every suggesting that he's talking about.  YouTube url's are not unique, in that multiple url's can point to the same location.  CraigsList urls are not hackable, or readable.
