If you don't hold the same view, then I think we can respectfully disagree.\n\nI respect your value-based ethics highly, even if I do not agree completely with your views.  However, other ethical approaches are possible, for instance a utilistic one.  Vastly simplified, one just asks \"Will more people be helped/damaged by action X or action Y?\" and act accordingly to minimize the harm to the lot.  The latter has the disadvantage that it necessarily relies on estimates and one may overlook important secondary effects etc..  It has, however, the distinctive advantage that people with different principial values can agree on a common base and measure and come to an agreement, however imperfect.
