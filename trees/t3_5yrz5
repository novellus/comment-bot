Hopefully \n&gt;you can use this in your next discussion with \n&gt;a creationist.\n\nExcepting that creationists don't make this argument, they make a different one. And the climate change is not sufficient. You asked about population growth and *agriculture* explains that. The *next* question, which you did not ask, is why it got started when it did. And there is *evidence*, not a conclusive answer yet at all but evidence, that various climate change events helped lead to the spread of humans around the globe and then to the availability of agriculture.\n\n&gt;so you're claiming that the knowledge of \n&gt;agriculture was passed between \n&gt;civilizations? \n\nCivilization is a poor word to use there, try society. And I am saying that it is possible that knowledge of agriculture is one of many things that passed between human groups. Discovery of agriculture was not an event, but a process extended over time. What does seem significant, what is a big part of the difference between societies that have some agriculture and those that are agricultural societies, are the available plants. The Middle East and China had plants available (wheat/pulses and rice respectively) that were particularly amenable to larger scale agriculture. Corn and potatoes, OTOH, were not at good. (Corn took a long time to evolve to something useful and both corn and potatoes are nutritionally deficient compared to wheat and bean or even rice.) \n\n&gt;This explanation fails when talking about \n&gt;mesoamerica though. You'd have to claim \n&gt;knowledge of agriculture prior to closing \n&gt;the land bridge to america.\n\nThe \"land bridge\" idea is pretty defunct. There was a repeated opening and closing of the door there. (And so successive waves of movement from Asia to the Americas.) Large scale agricultural societies only develop when you have the relevant plants. The Americas did not have plants as good as those in the Middle East and Asia. \n\n&gt;&gt;so show me the evidence that it was \n&gt;&gt;developed simultaneously in multiple places\n&gt;&gt;around the world.\n\n&gt;This wiki entry states it started in \n&gt;multiple locations, would you like me to \n&gt;give a better reference than wikipedia?\n\nNo, I would like something for the *simultaneous* claim. It is quite possible that it developed a few times. Your original claim, though, was simultaneously everywhere.\n\n&gt;I'm not afraid of evidence, hell or \n&gt;reincarnation. \n\nWhy do you put those three together? I mean other than to present an apparent but not actual argument about something or other?\n\n&gt;Bring them on, which of the tomes should I \n&gt;read and when should I genuflect?\n\nGenuflect whenever you wish, I have no concern about that at all. I suggest Diamond's trilogy to do a nice job on these questions.\n\nBTW, you have still not shown anything of value that was done by creationists. Scientists had been studying the history of humanity without anything meaningful from the creationists.

You made some vague comments about population size. I was not about to start attacking strawmen, so I wanted you to make the claim explicitly. \n\nAs to your claim, no this is not a \"good point\" brought up by creationists. To make their point they have to assume a constant growth rate through history and we have *evidence* that the growth rate isn't constant. It has seriously accelerated in modern times. Assuming the constant growth rate means that there were something like 100 people when the pyramids were built and only 6 million at the time of the Romans.\n\n&gt;Agriculture is what pins your theory \n&gt;together and is the reason it took 95,000 \n&gt;years for its discovery to allow man to \n&gt;start modern civilization?\n\nAgain, the question does not make sense. If you are asking why it took that long for humans to develop agriculture then the climate change issue is probably relevant. We came out of the last ice age only 12K years ago and there has been pretty significant changes since then.\n\n&gt;This leads to the question of why did it \n&gt;take 95,000 years to discover agriculture \n&gt;and then it was discovered virtually at the \n&gt;same time in multiple locations around the \n&gt;world? Coincidence?\n\nIt was not discovered at the same time around the world and humans have communicated with other humans for all of our history. There have been very few cases of truly isolated human populations. Australian Aboriginals were isolated about 40-50K years ago, and did not have agriculture. And a few island populations have been isolated, but they are not significant for this discussion since the geography of the islands affects the society. For the rest of the world agriculture we don't know (AFAIK) if it was developed in more than one place of it it was carried with people as it migrated.\n\n&gt;Yes not only is it a coincidence, but a huge\n&gt;and stellar coincidence!\n\nGreat: so show me the evidence that it was developed simultaneously in multiple places around the world. \n\n&gt;again you can't formulate a response and so \n&gt;you say \"so it was written, so it was told\".\n&gt;Should I give you an Amen!\n\nI am sorry that you are afraid of evidence.

That is, species A went extinct for one reason, species B when extinct for another. I have made a major point that I think you skip over because you don't grasp the significance: there is no particular reason to expect there to be more members of our genus alive. There are two Pan, but only one Gorilla, for example. The gap between us and Pan/Gorilla is neither particularly larger nor particularly small.

But I do admit it was pretty close for a quote off the top of your head.\n\nHowever you've misunderstood this third link, because it makes no reference to neanderthal and is supposedly talking about sapiens.\n\nThe second link is completely a red herring, because there is no reference that I saw to anything at 70,000 ybp.

Thats is what I've been saying all along and now that I debate you into the ground about it, you finally acknowledge it as a creationist question.\n\nMaybe the problem is that you are not a particularly good writer. I have had to struggle to make sense of your posts and figure out what question you are asking. You said there were good question from the creationists, this is a *bad* question. It is a question that betrays a deep ignorance of how evolution works. I have given the answer multiple times, I hope you figure it out.\n\n\n&gt;you just admitted that they ask lots of questions about \"transitional\" species. Are you questioning the value of asking such a question about the transitional stages of human development?\n\nThis is an example of either your sloppy writing or your sloppy thinking. No, I did not admit they ask lots of questions about transitions species, I said that there is a frequent creationist demand for a \"transitional\" species for any two given species. It is just fine to ask about the history of evolution (stages is still a poor misleading term, if you don't understand why I can explain again). I question the value of the specific questions they and you ask, not the asking of questions. Telling you that you have asked a poorly stated question does not mean I am against questions. \n\nSo let me re-cap: it is not only fine to wonder about the history of human evolution and our close relatives, it is a much studied scientific subject. Asking questions about that is just fine. It is even reason to ask what happened to the various other members of the genus Homo. The lack of any existent members of Homo other than H. sapiens is not, however, suggestive that evolution does not occur or that humans are special, or that there is a problem with the idea that humans evolved. Those are the creationist claims there and those claims are wrong. \n\nAs I have pointed out, there is no particular reason for the to be a gap of some size and not another. Specifics of history, specifics of feature, etc, determine the sizes of these gaps. For some organisms we might find lots of closely related species, for different groups we might find a larger distance. There are people who do study this question to see if there are general rules involved. \n\n&gt;&gt;there was a genetic bottleneck some 70,000 years ago, the population reduced to about 15K individuals.\n\n&gt;What source are you citing for this? I'm not sure you quite know what the implications of a genetic bottleneck are, especially if you're associating this to the disappearance of the neanderthal\n\nYou can read about this bottleneck here:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_bottleneck\n\nAnd here:\n\nhttp://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/17/1/2\n\nAnd here:\n\nhttp://medicine.jrank.org/pages/2674/Population-Bottleneck.html\n\nWhen reading about this keep two ideas separate: the event and the cause. We are pretty sure that the bottleneck occurred, we are not at all as such about why. There are lots of proposed causes and this relates to another hotly debated question: how and when did humans leave Africa. \n\nAs to Neanderthal, the bottleneck was about 70K years ago, Neandertal went extinct some 25K years ago. So they were not wiped out by the same event. My point was that it might just be luck that we survived when we did. Perhaps, and I am speculating, Neandertal was hurt by the same event and did not recover. Or perhaps we did out-compete them for one of the many reasons proposed (smarter, better immune system, more dexterous, etc.). My point is that we should not jump to the idea that all evolution is selective.\n\n&gt;May I ask what side I am on?\n\nYours. The sides are those of the conversation: mine and yours.

As it happens gorillas are as close to humans as they are to chimps, so your question is the same as asking for some species closer to gorilla than are humans or chimps. We may well think we are special, but that does not make us special.\n\nThe details of the history of Homo and Australopithecus are interesting and explored, but there is no systemic problem in why we don't have closer relatives. Through history various answers have been proposed, often reflecting the state of society as much as anything else. It has been suggested that we are more violent than our relatives or smarter or more dexterous. Most of those answers have been found to be wrong or unsupported. I seriously don't know the current thinking on why Neanderthal et.al. died out and we did not. Perhaps it was just luck, there was a genetic bottleneck some 70,000 years ago, the population reduced to about 15K individuals.

I came up with it from listening to a creationist debate.\n\n&gt; This is, AFAIK, still a debated point in paleontology.\n\nno, the debate is not whether its a subspecies, but rather what happened to it. It really is the heart of the question that I heard a creationist ask.\n\n&gt; Given the number of bone headed errors you have made you should really not try for some technical victories.\n\nbone headed, yeah OK, I'm not the one spouting off about 10+ years of debating creationists. You don't have the science understood yourself, how can you debate against them? \n\nThis started off as a informal discussion and not the confrontation you've made it out to be. I can only suspect that you think I'm a creationist pretending to casually discuss a topic. Of course I'm not and I am scared to think how condescending you acted in all your other discussions with real creationists.\n\n&gt; Again, it is an interesting question why we survived and they did not, but this still is not a creationist question. \n\nOf course its a creationist question, you're just trying not to agree. You have forced me into poising the question in strict scientific language and now you want to change it into being a scientific question.\n\nYou're making the same error I see many times with others. You're trying to change the discussion into an \"Us vs Them\" type of discussion and that is not what science is about. A creationist can us science equally as well as a non-creationist. Listen to them, they use science a lot in their discussions and the trick to find the point at which they injected a fallacy into their line of reasoning.\n\nSo there really is no \"creationist question\",  all questions are really scientific questions. The use of the science is selectively used to support creationist claims.\n\nSo if you insist on denying its a \"creationists question\" I'll rephrase it back to regular everyday language.\n\n* If evolution is correct and man evolved gradually from apes, where then is a man-ape being?\n\nYou failed answering this correctly for Homo erectus, so I don't expect you to answer their claim in this format.

The fate of most genera is to go extinct.\n\n&gt;I would think everyone should think it an interesting question as to why these ancestors of ours faded from existence.\n\nYes, that is an interesting question. There is plenty of paleontology work done to answer those questions. These are not, however, creationist questions and you were to show us some interesting questions brought up by creationists. Personally I am not terribly interested in the history of human evolution so I am not up on the details of recent research. Do you have something specific to ask?\n\n&gt;I just wanted to show how you don't understand the concept of an \"evolutionary stage\" in the course of human evolution.\n\nI agree, I don't understand *your* concept of evolutionary stage. Biological evolution is a continual process, not a pre-determined set of stages. If you questions above have something to do with these \"stages\" then you should explain what you mean. I saw you ask about particular branches on the tree, not stages of evolution. Stage certainly sounds like the antiquated notion of the ladder of life: was that what you meant?\n\n&gt;Homo sapiens neandertalensis is a subspecies technically,\n\nThis is, AFAIK, still a debated point in paleontology. Given the number of bone headed errors you have made you should really not try for some technical victories. \n\n&gt;but many people can consider them an ancestor of ours\n\nAgain a debated point but I think that the evidence strongly points to the cousin position rather than ancestor. The question is whether or not there was sufficient gene flow between the populations.\n\n&gt;We can see that other relatives of ours, such as the great apes, have survived comfortably alongside mankind, so to suggest that Homo sapiens sapiens crowded out Homo sapiens neandertalensis from habitable space seems a bit far fetched and is not an acceptable answer.\n\nDo you have a question here? It seems that you have set up a strawman, that \"habitable space\" was the only limiting factor. Again, it is an interesting question why we survived and they did not, but this still is not a creationist question. It is something that scientists are working on. \n\nNow as stated your \"question\" still does not make sense. We have relatives of a particular distance (the great apes) and we don't have closer ones. First off, no matter what we would have some relatives that are our closest living relative. There is no particular a priori reason to think that they should be a particular distance away. Second, there is no particular reason to think that any given branch would survive, most don't. The gap between us and the great apes is neither the largest nor the smallest in the world. It is of interested to us because we are humans, but it is not of general interest qua evolution. \n\n\n\n", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "name": "t1_c02b1dc", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5yrz5", "retrieved_on": 1427425579, "score_hidden": false, "body": "&gt; I pick apart your sentences because they seem to rest on errors in biology.\n\nthat is because you want to avoid the central question.

I think you missed the point, but he grasped it sufficiently to answer it easily enough. \n\n&gt; your question involved far more recent times than that.\n\nPerhaps I didn't lay it out completely for you to grasp it sufficiently, so I apologize.

Only one survives today.\n\nHomo sapiens neandertalensis is a subspecies technically, but many people can consider them an ancestor of ours and while this might not be technically correct, it still isn't completely outrageous as I suppose you'll contend.\n\nSo here is the question that I believe creationists want answered:\n\n* If Homo sapiens neandertalensis and Homo sapiens sapiens were both evolved from Homo erectus, where is Homo sapiens neandertalensis today?\n\nWe can see that other relatives of ours, such as the great apes, have survived comfortably alongside mankind, so to suggest that Homo sapiens sapiens crowded out Homo sapiens neandertalensis from habitable space seems a bit far fetched and is not an acceptable answer.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02ay7r", "id": "c02b1dc", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 1, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5yrz5", "retrieved_on": 1427425620, "id": "c02ay7r", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02ay7r", "parent_id": "t1_c02awju", "body": "&gt;&gt;why do you expect that we should have an existing relative closer to use than chimps/gorillas?\n\n&gt;because we have distant ancestors that supposedly evolved through some diversification\n&gt;mechanism (drift, speciation, whatever you \nwant to call it).\n\nSpeciation occurs via selection and drift. \n\n&gt;This resulted in a new species (genus perhaps if you feel the need to get so technical), \n\nI do feel that technical words are important when discussing technical subjects. And diversification results in new species, genera, families, etc. There were many species in the genus Homo. Only one survives today.\n\n&gt;All these different stages had viable populations that thrived obviously or we wouldn't be here right now. However after the next evolutionary stage, this apparently thriving population disappeared completely.\n\nThat is pretty confused. That \"next evolutionary stage\" comment is wrong. At some point sister species disappeared. When is a question answered by the evidence. Homo neandertalis died out about 50K years ago or so.\n\n&gt;Yet there are other more distant ape relatives that were able to thrive alongside us and are with us today.\n\nYes, that is how it works for all life. It is a tree-like nested hierarchy with pruning. So every species has relatives of various degrees of closeness.Our closest are chimps/gorillas (and it is pretty difficult, if not impossible, to determine which are closer to us). But realize that gorillas do not have a relative closer than humans either while there are two distinct species of chimpanzee which are closer to each other than they are to humans/gorilla.\n\n\n\n&gt;Have I completely laid it out for you to make it without a shadow of a doubt to the idea behind it?\n\nI see the question, I just don't see it as particularly interesting. You have not shown why the distance between humans and chimps/gorillas is particularly further than we have reason to expect. As a human I am interested in the history of H. sapiens and want to know what happened to our various relatives. But I also know that there are plenty of cases of species with relatives further away than chimps are from us.\n\n\n&gt;I think I can predict you trying to further pick apparent my terminology or specific sentences as if I was the first person to present this idea\n\nI pick apart your sentences because they seem to rest on errors in biology.

Speciation, what I suspect you mean by diversify, is one possible result. But a population can remain one species as well for a long time. The issue of the rate and process of speciation is an interesting one.\n\nYou really should look up drift was well. Not all evolution is selection, not all evolution leads to \"better adaption\". The evidence is good that most evolution (measured by fixation of mutations in a population) does occur by drift.

You later implied something about a nonsensical creationist claim regarding a constant growth rate. But debunking that claim does not require discussing the origin of civilization. The fallacy in the creationist claim is not the origin of agriculture, it is not global climate change, it is that population growth has taken off in the last few hundred years, that the rate of growth is not close to constant. It is debunked by running their numbers and showing that by their logic there were only a hundred or so people at the time of the pyramids, that there were a few million at most at the time of the Romans.

First, not all evolution, and not all speciation, happens because of selection. Drift is a major force of evolution (if you don't know about drift and neutral theory you should probably read rather than write on this topic). Plenty of speciation happens because of drift.\n\nSecond, a species can out-compete another species, even a closely related one, without \"filling\" the available space.

The reason is genetic.  Those things that have a genetic propensity to want to survive, do so.  Those things that have *no* genetic propensity to want to survive die off.  This is why survival is one of the most basic instincts of almost all organisms.  Because all organisms that had no will to survive died off.\n\n&gt;Yet it gives no explanation for why survival would be a desirable trait in of itself?\n\nIt's not an inherently desirable trait.  It's just that survival is a trait that, by its very nature, propagates itself.  Things that \"want\" (I'll address the \"want\" part a bit further down) to survive are more likely to give birth to more things that \"want\" to survive.\n\n&gt;I would assume that no living, or not surviving, would be the most natural state in the Universe.\n\nIt *is* the most natural state.  99.999% of the universe is comprised of non-living matter.\n\n&gt;why does carbon in certain combinations desire to survive, while helium or other elements in certain combinations stay in a state of rest? It's an important question, and evolution does not attempt to answer this question.\n\nEvolution answers that quite clearly.  As long as survival is a trait that can be passed on to offspring, then things that attempt to survive are more likely to have offspring (since they survived longer), and those offspring are more likely to attempt to survive themselves (since survival is an inheritable trait.\n\n&gt;We tend to use words like \"survive\" or say things like \"traits that increase the ability of an organism to reproduce,\" but we do not explain why on earth would anything want to reproduce.\n\nIt's not a matter of *wanting* to reproduce in most cases.  You're attempting to anthropomorphize thing that have no ability to think in the first place.  Bacteria don't \"want\" to survive. They just do, because they're composed of bits of matter that perform actions that optimize their survival.  There's no \"will\" or \"desire\" to survive.  There's just that fact that those things that have the right mechanisms to survive are the only ones that don't go extinct.\n\n&gt;Yet somehow we take for granted this anomaly called life, an anomaly which goes against every rule of physics.\n\nLife doesn't go against any rule of physics at all.\n\n&gt;Why on earth would something not stay in a state of rest like most of the universe?\n\nChance.  Once you end up accidentally getting **one** thing that can propagate, then the process of life has begun, and it's quite difficult to stop.\n\n&gt;Why on earth would something in fact become more orderly and more perfected over time? That just doesn't make sense.\n\nYou're a bit confused about the \"more orderly and more perfected\" part.  That's not how evolution works.

If something didn't want to survive, then it wouldn't, as so it wouldn't have offspring and would go extinct very quickly.\r\n\r\nIt's a very straightforward question. Survival is a willful trait. The desire to survive implies something wills to survive. Are you saying that the desire for an organism to propagate willful traits is without reason? \r\n\r\nIt makes no sense why an organism at its most basic level would want to select. Do you see what I'm saying? Evolution argues that organisms select in order to survive. But why would an organism want to survive? Do you know why you want to live? I doubt you can explain it in logical terms. But why does a carbon molecule want to propagate? I am certain it could not explain this. It's very odd. That is certainly a relevent question, because evolution is a theory based on the assumption that organisms want to survive. Yet it gives no explanation for why survival would be a desirable trait in of itself? If anything, I would assume that no living, or not surviving, would be the most natural state in the Universe. If life was truly rational, then why would it want to survive or live? Wouldn't the more logical goal be to not survive and not propagate? What does anything - whether carbon based or non-living - have to gain from survival? And more important, why does carbon in certain combinations desire to survive, while helium or other elements in certain combinations stay in a state of rest? It's an important question, and evolution does not attempt to answer this question. \r\n\r\nThe creationists fall short in that they write off evolution completely. But evolution is clearly an all but proven theory. The real issue is that evolution bases its theories off of sweeping assumptions, which while seemingly correct, go completely unexplained. We tend to use words like \"survive\" or say things like \"traits that increase the ability of an organism to reproduce,\" but we do not explain why on earth would anything want to reproduce. The natural state of Universe would appear to be staying at rest. Almost all matter in the universe is entropic and without any goal or initiative, except when reacing to certain forces. Yet somehow we take for granted this anomaly called life, an anomaly which goes against every rule of physics. Why on earth would something not stay in a state of rest like most of the universe? Why on earth would something in fact become more orderly and more perfected over time? That just doesn't make sense. Evolution simply documents an observation of growth over time. Yet it does nothing to refute creationism in its most non-religious form. \r\n", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02ah8y", "parent_id": "t1_c02ah13", "id": "c02ah8y", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "name": "t1_c02ah13", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "ups": 3, "link_id": "t3_5yrz5", "retrieved_on": 1427425843, "id": "c02ah13", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02agjr", "body": "&gt;Can someone explain why evolution would even distinguish between \"desirable\" and \"undesirable\" traits?\n\n\"Desirable\" and \"undesirable\" are simply shorthand for \"traits that increase the ability of an organism to reproduce\" and \"traits that decrease the ability of an organism to reproduce\". \n\n&gt;In other words, why would something want to survive or not survive.\n\nI'm not sure I understand the question.
