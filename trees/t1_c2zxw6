The Heisenburg principle only applies at the quantum level, when either the position or momentum/speed of an electron is needed.\n\nWrong. If you are talking about fluid mechanics, the quantum fuzziness alone (i.e. assuming you had a computer with infinite precision and no roundoff error) around every molecule is enough to make your predictions about the turbulence and flow accurate only for a certain timescale. Maybe 2*timescale after that your simulation has no similarity at all to the real world system...", "author": "nphinit", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c029add", "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c029add", "parent_id": "t1_c2zxw6", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}
