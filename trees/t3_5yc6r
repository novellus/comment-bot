I've gone through spells where I wanted to talk about something that I didn't think my wife would want to discuss, or I knew would end in an argument.  How does keeping it bottled up help?  Sometimes, you need that 3rd party for a fresh perspective.  There is one woman in my life that I will probably never meet in real life, she is also married, and whenever either of us have a serious issue with our spouse, we seek out each other's advice through e-mail.  I think it's done more to help my marriage than hurt it.  She needs to understand that her man isn't being short with her and less romantic *because* he is writing another woman, he is writing another woman to discuss what is causing his issues.  Also, does the person who wrote that piece of advice not see the irony here?  This woman wrote to you to discuss her problems that she didn't feel she could discuss with her boyfriend.  But he's wrong for doing basically the same thing?..", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5yc6r", "id": "c029b84", "author_flair_css_class": null}
