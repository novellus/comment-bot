My mother had me into the doctor's office every week as I became more and more ill.  His response?  That I was faking it for attention.  \n\nBy the time I was 5 years old, I was 29lbs and had to be hospitalized in the ICU ward of a children's hospital in a different town.  I remember being there for a solid week, having blood taken every day, drinking that white xray juice (I think it's a liquid chalk), and going through every test known to man (slight  exaggeration).  \n\nFinally a specialist came up with the answer.  Celiac Disease.  The regular doctors had no clue.  He saved my life.\n\nEvery time I go for a checkup or visit a doctor for any reason, I have to explain to them what Celiac Disease is.  I have never encountered a regular doctor that knew about CD.  To that end, who can blame them?  I'm sure that there are almost more things to be sick from than there are people to be made sick by them!  \n\nIf it is truly as prevalent as this article suggests, then I think that it should have more attention.  Granted, I have a personal bias... but still.\n\nThere was one point that this article failed to mention...  slight sidebar here... CD is often coupled with Lactose Intolerance.  So one can start eliminating gluten from their diet, but the dairy can still be kicking their butt.  I am both a Celiac and Lactose Intolerant, for example.  Fortunately there are options for Lactose Intolerance.
