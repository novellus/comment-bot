The Japanese would have lost millions more including elderly men, women and children as they were prepared to try to repel the invasion with whatever they had available including rakes and pitchforks.\nIt was Emperor Hirohito that finally interceded on behalf of the Japanese people to put an end to the fighting at once rather than continue in the hope of getting the US and our allies to accept a negotiated rather than an unconditional surrender.  And it was the bomb that made him as he said to the Japanese people \u201cThe enemy now possesses a new and terrible weapon with the power to destroy many innocent lives and do incalculable damage\".
