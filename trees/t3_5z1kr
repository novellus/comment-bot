Not to mention that the US has not played nice in the Americas for a long time.\n\nAnd 2004.\n\nAnd all that personal consumption. \n\nGee, you sure don't make it easy on us to want to bail you out just yet.\n\nAnd finally, if this is serious, if this is an actual request and not merely pushing the problem to someone else when the going gets too hard after 18 months, why effing suggest you'd side with the administration if it came to military intervention. Way to show your commitment there. \n\nTo get all Godwin-y: I'm sure the US soldiers dying on the beaches of Normandy were glad the Germans there had similar faith in the integrity of their own country even if its administration was bad.", "author": "zipdog", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c02b43a", "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": "t3_5z1kr", "name": "t1_c02b43a", "author_flair_css_class": null}
