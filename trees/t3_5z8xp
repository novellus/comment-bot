It's a vicious cycle of effects that start with improper nutrition - not necessarily just starvation - and is compounded by the resulting illnesses and the problems of recovering from illness in such difficult circumstances.\n\nThere's certainly more to addressing these problems than just handing out plumpynut to malnourished kids.  However, the plumpynut is a critical first step, because in helping malnourished kids to recover from their symptoms so quickly, it gains the aid workers huge credibility with parents.  The parents are then much more likely to follow advice about childcare, diet, and hygiene after the children have recovered, and to give the children supplements to make up for lack of micronutrients in their regular diets - things like iron, iodine, vitamins A, B &amp; C, sodium, calcium, potassium, and zinc, without which children begin the downward cycle of malnutrition again.\n\nPlumpynut was invented in 1997 and has been used successfully in many countries in Africa, including Niger, Sierra Leone, Malawi, as well as some non-African countries such as Cambodia.  It was used during to treat children during a food crisis in Niger in 2005.  Aid workers have experience with it and they know that it works, and that malnourished children can safely be taken off it after as little as four weeks.  At the outside, they don't give it to children for more than about three months, and long before that they'll be investigating why a child is not recovering, e.g. because other family members are eating the plumpynut, or because the child is HIV-positive.  They know that if a child can make it to about 2 or 3 years old without damage from malnutrition, that most of them will grow up healthy.\n\nAfrican countries are starting to manufacture plumpynut - Niger manufactures about 40 tons a month, and other countries are following suit, so they're not totally reliant on direct food aid, and the manufacturing helps the local economies.  So it's all part of a process which is only in its early stages.  It's good news and a step forward, it's not an ultimate solution.\n\nThe goal, as I mentioned, is to help people escape what [this article](http://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/subjindx/113hung.htm)\ndescribes as \"a generational cycle of poverty, as a malnourished girl tends to grow up and bear underweight, malnourished children; and malnourished children are likely to be intellectually impaired, with diminished productive and creative capacities.\"   ", "author": "antonivs", "created_utc": "1193553751", "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "archived": true, "subreddit": "science", "ups": 3, "parent_id": "t1_c02bqox", "id": "c02brj3", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "science", "ups": -1, "name": "t1_c02bqox", "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5z8xp", "retrieved_on": 1427425180, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02bqox", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02bq6i", "body": "if there were \"normal foods available,\" they wouldn't need the plumpynut in the first place, would they?", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "name": "t1_c02bq6i", "ups": 7, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5z8xp", "retrieved_on": 1427425188, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02bq6i", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "parent_id": "t1_c02bq51", "body": "  Plumpynut is specifically for \"severe acute malnutrition\" (SAM) and is not intended as a long-term foodstuff.
