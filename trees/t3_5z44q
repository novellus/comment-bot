It sounds great, but there's no net gain on petroleum savings. \r\n\r\nFirst, you need to cart the used plastic in trucks, which use oil in gas, tires and the manufacture of the trucks themselves. \r\n\r\nThen, we cart this plastic to a plant, which uses electricity - more oil. Then, government subsidizes these operations, which would normally not exist without this intervention. Why? There's no net savings of resources.\r\n\r\nThe same applies to companies selling carbon offsets. Many of them can't agree on the basic calculations, let alone demonstrate how their product is nothing more than a happy feel good boondoggle. \r\n\r\nBut if you want to invest in and buy carbon offsets becuase it feels good, by all means go for it. Just know what you're buying. And it should be said that this world does need more companies offering ways to feel good. I can't disagree with that unless it involves making others feel bad. \r\n\r\nSame applies to paper. In fact, the logging industry has created 30% more trees than there were in the beginning of the 1900's - at least in the US. \r\n\r\nLikewise, we're consuming tons of french fries, potato chips and similar product. But there's no spud recycling or shortage. Unfortunately, subsidized agriculture has become aggressively inneffient in terms of nutritional value. We dump petroleum based fertilizers in soil as opposed to rotating crops and leaving soil fallow. Add in genetic engineering, and the food quality goes down so dramatically that we need to consume twice the original volume. \r\n\r\nAnd modern food is made for volume, not nutritional value. \r\n\r\nWhile recycling paper and plastic produces no net gain of resources or savings on pollution, recycling metals does. That's why companies recycling metals have existed before government subsidy. \r\n\r\nSocially responsible investing is really simple. Just find a company looking to solve a problem through a new product or innovative service. \r\n\r\n\r\n", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5z44q", "id": "c02bapx", "author_flair_css_class": null}
