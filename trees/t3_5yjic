While semen is not a full genetic code, it is very much the potential to create a full human being. It can't possibly hold the same rights as a fully grown human being, though. \n\nIn fact, the formation of a zygote in no way ensures the birth of a human being. Miscarriages are a very natural event so a fertilized embryo could abort itself at any moment. What difference is there in removing it ourselves? What difference is there in using contraceptives that forcibly begin menstruation?
