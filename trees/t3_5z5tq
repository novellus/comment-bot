Most indentured slaves were white.\r\n\r\nMadison also set up the constitution so as to give the appearance of democracy; he said that democracy was wrong for america, but he wanted the appearance of democracy.\r\n\r\n Madison was called the Father of the Constitution. He designed our government so as to protect the rich (which he referred to as the \"minority of the opulent\") from the majority.\r\n\r\nMadison created america as a republic because he knew that the president and senate, being elected from across the entire nation, would be unaccountable to the voters in general.\r\n\r\n\r\nMadison wrote that the most important function of a government should be to maintain inequality in wealth. So he set up a constitution that would help him and his fellow founding fathers keep their wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMadison wrote and said that politicians elected from large districts would be unaccountable to the voters because larger districts would have lots of factions and therefore the voters could not \"unite and find their common interests\". \r\nThat is why madison and the founding fathers included a president and a senate in the constitution. He knew that because the president and the senators were elected from large districts, that it would be very hard for the voters to organize sufficiently so as to be able to hold their president and senators accountable. \r\n\r\n\r\nMadison wrote that, in this way, the voters would find it hard to \"unite\" and find their \"common interest.\"\r\n\r\nAlso he knew that it would take a lot of money and power to be elected in a large district (eg. the entire nation), so that way it would be very likely that these politicians would be rich like madison and the rest of the founding fathers. \r\n\r\nIn contrast, the nations with parliaments do not elect politicians from across the entire nation. Each politician is elected from a small district, and is therefore accountable to the voters of that district. And because the districts are smaller, you do not have to be rich to get elected there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMadison wanted to keep the voters from being able to change the government, to prevent \"innovation\" in government. He and his fellow founding fathers knew that if the voters had their way, they would tax the rich and protect the citizenry from the rich, like they do over in western europe. Madison and his fellow wealthy founding fathers did not want that. So they instituted the constitution we have today.\r\n\r\nhere is an article written by Woody Holton, PhD, a history professor, that explains some of these things:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4026/is_200607/ai_n17187913/pg_1\r\n\r\n\r\n        ", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "parent_id": "t1_c02bftt", "id": "c02bgc0", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 4, "author": "liberals_r_noobs", "created_utc": "1193417654", "children": [{"subreddit": "politics", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 1, "author": "robywar", "created_utc": "1193418484", "children": [{"controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "politics", "archived": true, "ups": -1, "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5z5tq", "retrieved_on": 1427425275, "score": -1, "id": "c02bjdo", "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": "1193427340", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "body": "His valid point is pretty flawed.\n\nSaying \"hey this guy said something, and he wrote the constitution, so its got to be true!\" is about as stupid as people basing their lives on a book about a cosmic zombie jew.", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "name": "t1_c02bjdo", "parent_id": "t1_c02bi5p", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "ups": 1, "name": "t1_c02bi5p", "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5z5tq", "retrieved_on": 1427425291, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02bi5p", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02bi28", "body": "Ah, the difference between a post with a valid point and a troll.", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"subreddit": "politics", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": -5, "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": "1193427291", "children": [{"subreddit": "politics", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 1, "author": "liberals_r_noobs", "created_utc": "1193518323", "children": [{"controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "politics", "archived": true, "ups": -1, "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5z5tq", "retrieved_on": 1427425184, "score": -1, "created_utc": "1193534726", "body": "regardless, the point the OP was trying to make was that the founding fathers had it all right, and they didnt.", "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c02bqds", "parent_id": "t1_c02bp7v", "id": "c02bqds", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "ups": 1, "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5z5tq", "retrieved_on": 1427425199, "id": "c02bp7v", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02bp7v", "parent_id": "t1_c02bjdd", "body": "The evidence shows that John Adams, and his son after him, were vehemently opposed to the slavery system, as is attested to by their numerous orations against it.
