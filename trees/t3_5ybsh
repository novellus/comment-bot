That college students today have inherited a set of problems that they are tasked to solve, yet have no reasonable means by which to solve them?  That there is a ridiculous amount of trust in technology among students today?  The whole video is so fractured, that I hesitate to comment on any one point they try to make for fear of missing the forest for the trees.", "author": "Zuph", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c029abv", "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": "t3_5ybsh", "name": "t1_c029abv", "author_flair_css_class": null}
