I saw this on the Discovery Channel once :)  Some spying diplomat in now-eastern-Europe was killed inside his armored car by a bomb like these EFPs... a backpack hung on a parking meter, filled with TNT, with a copper plate on the street-side of the explosives. The copper plate deformed into a spike-like shape from the force of the blast and went clear through the backseat of the car, nearly tore it in half, and the man actually died because an edge of the molten copper spike cut open his throat on its way through the car.", "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": "1192573457", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "politics", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5yevr", "id": "c029kdz", "author_flair_css_class": null}
