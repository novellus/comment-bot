If you're going to label it as a \"Han invasion\" then you've adopted a similarly myoptic viewpoint that both sides have refused to get out of. To say that it is merely \"The Han\" that invaded Tibet is to whitewash the past 50-60 years (or more) of history.\n\nTo put it clearly, both Nationalist and Communist China have claimed Tibet as part of China for as long as modern history (ie. 1900ish onward) has been in existence. In fact, Chinese-Tibet relations extend back for centuries -- several of them if you count Mongol China. Younghusband, one of the British Expeditioners to Tibet, once said that China only had a \"loose suzernity (spelling?) over Tibet\", but one has to realize that this was in the context of the Great Game, where every power in the world was fighting for colonies.\n\nAnyway, back to the point. Tibet's independence is not clear cut because they -- being the ruling sect at the time, be it the Sakyas or the Gelugs -- have always associated themselves with a Patron-Priest relationship with the major power at the time (or so the cultural narrative goes, since the other side may keep an entirely different record). In exchange for political deferrence, the \"Patron\" (either the Khans or the Emperors) would give the sect both temporal and spiritual control over the region. And that's how it has worked until modern history, when modern China basically said no to the whole deal.\n\nSo fast forward in time and you've come to today where the US/UN pretty much gave up on the Tibet independence issue in the 1950s, haphazard CIA-backed operations against communist China, Dalai Lama winning the Nobel Peace prize, and so many strange things that you'd think you would only read in story books.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "ups": 2, "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5yvaq", "retrieved_on": 1427425749, "id": "c02ao9e", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "name": "t1_c02ao9e", "parent_id": "t1_c02ant7", "body": " i doubt that any culture want to be oppressed by another. i have met a few tibetians and not one of them was happy with the han invasion of their region. and you are fooling yourself if you don't think that most of china is living in serfdom.", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_6", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": -1, "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": "1193103174", "children": [{"controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "created_utc": "1193105009", "ups": 1, "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5yvaq", "retrieved_on": 1427425739, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02ap0s", "author": "JJFO", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c02ap0s", "parent_id": "t1_c02aouu", "body": "I don't, I just think we should leave Tibet to the Tibetans", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "score_hidden": false, "ups": -1, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5yvaq", "retrieved_on": 1427425741, "body": " you seem to know what's best for everyone.\n\nthat's quite a black kettle you're stewing in.
