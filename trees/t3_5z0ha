I don't consider  myself an expert (because apparently there are many many types of meditation techniques out there) but I think the main benefits of meditation are to quiet the mind; and to make it easier to turn attention back upon itself.  Which is in a way what the whole 'enlightenment' thing is all about: a shift in identification from the conditioned self (or ego) to the unconditioned awareness that is the universal Self. Or in other words: awareness becoming aware of itself. Words kinda suck when you're trying to describe this btw ;)\n\nThe way I look at it, most types of meditation I've come across are just ways of manipulating or altering experience, which can be fun, but really all they do is enforce the whole dualistic illusion. In my (very humble) opinion, the best form of meditation would be to take every moment exactly as it comes, without trying to change anything about it (including telling the mind to shut up ;). Then after a while turning attention back onto what it is that is *aware* of each passing moment, including your thoughts etc. If it gets boring: try to see what is aware of boredom; if it's pleasant: what is aware of that. Etc. \nBut if you're interested in meditation I'd recommend finding out for yourself what works, and what does not work, for you. Don't rely on anyone else to tell you anything; No one has more or less truth inside them as you, or anyone else, has.

Actually it's a lot closer to the truth to say that one suddenly realizes there is, in fact, nothing to realize, as ones true nature is what is called 'empty'. So 'enlightenment' is the direct realization of ones nature as emptiness and the lack of personal identity or ego. Also it is seen that the seeking for enlightenment is, in fact, the thing that is obscuring it; for one is already that which is sought; it simply is not possible to be anything else. \n\nIt's true the Buddha practiced asceticism for a number of years in an effort to 'reach enlightenment'. But only after he saw that got him nowhere and realized the 'middle way' as he called it, there was the self-realization.\n\nIt's important to remember that one does not need to be a buddhist (or anything else, for that matter) to 'become enlightened'. Though buddhism is one of only a few enlightenment-oriented ways of life, so it's kinda logical to look in to, if you're interested in that kind of thing ;)\n\nFor those interested in enlightenment I'd recommend looking very closely at all your concepts about yourself, your mind, and the world around you, and try to discover which ones are true. Try to figure out what you are, and what you are not. If that is done earnestly and with integrity, that's really all that's needed.\n\nedit:\nI'd just like to add that in my experience buddhism is not only concerned with enlightenment, but (maybe even more) with life after enlightenment and living in such a way that *that which is awake* functions *through* ego. In stead of ego functioning through ego. It's kinda hard to explain but when it happens it's pretty much self-validating.
