I'm not so happy to be lectured about OO in the context of Perl.  (And while he doesn't explicitly talk Perl, it's the Perlmonks site, so what other context are we supposed to assume?)\n\nThat's kind of like being lectured about regular expressions in the context of Java, or CGI programming in the context of C.\n", "author": "edheil", "created_utc": "1192917838", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c02ab2g", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "programming", "name": "t1_c02ab2g", "parent_id": "t3_5ypb2", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}

It's simply too much to hold in one's head, even if you can only access the internal state through the interface.\n\nOO is all about encapsulating state: into manageable chunks.\n\nThis is probably where he misses the point, as a Perl programmer where in most jobs all of the state is in a database.\n\n&gt; Object-oriented programming is a natural fit here. Say you create an abstract class called Tabulator, and concrete classes HTMLTabulator and CSVTabulator. The implementation details of the concrete classes differ, mainly in what kind of formatting they do, and the HTMLTabulator should probably support setting attributes to rows and columns in some way (such as alignment, width, or column or row spanning) or perhaps it uses templates, but once configuring is done, there is no difference. \n\nThat's better. The HTML table has state; its formatting attributes.
