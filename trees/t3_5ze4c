The network boot option would work, but only for the stationary subset of our machines.  Plus, it would put an additional dependency on our network that we're not quite sure we need.\n\nThere are a reasonable number of differences between systems.  Though we automate installs of systems, the package sets vary from user to user.  We've also got a couple different default image branches.\n\nWe're already centrally authenticating (LDAP / Krb5), but we maintain the root account locally in /etc/passwd. Managing this would be one example of where I'd hope to use something like Puppet or CFEngine. I know it can be done ad hoc, but I'd consider anything ad hoc to be retrograde to CFEngine or Puppet.\n\nIn terms of recovery, our policy is basically for users to store important stuff on a provided network share.  The reimaging process for individual systems is lightweight and easy, so we in most cases we wouldn't do much troubleshooting before simply reloading the system image.  so, we're not really looking to lean on a central management infrastructure for this.\n\nThe ability to do arbitrary centrally defined operations (present in CFEngine and Puppet currently), plus the metrics available from the server component of these tools are the primary selling features of those particular tools.\n\nThis thread may have already answered my question.
