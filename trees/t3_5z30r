Oh, some professor at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Not biased, then. :D\n\nIran is backed by China, with whom they have a trade agreement signed in 2004. China gets 15% of its oil &amp; gas from Iran, which it needs to fuel its MASSIVE economic &amp; social expansion. This is effectively a line in the sand drawn around them. China surfaced a sub less than a kilometer from the 5th fleet in the Gulf when they arrived. This was a message: we are watching. The US led attack on Iraq, in most part designed to control access to Iraq's huge oil reserves (no one with a functioning brain really denies this) is in part a 'long game' against China, to make sure that in the coming decade+, the West (USA) has monopoly on that precious oil rather than the emergent superpower of China.\n\nIran has the carrier-killer missile SUNBURN/MOSKIT. This is the Russian supersonic cruise missile to which there is no defense available on earth, and which even Israeli Military Intelligence sources admit Iran has bought in numbers. If Iran is attacked, the 5th fleet will be destroyed, either by Sunburn missiles launched from use-once launchers hidden in the Persian mountains, or by mobile boats, which war game sims have shown the fleet cannot stop. Iran will then scuttle tankers in the straights of Hormuz and block oil export to the west. Coupled with OPEC &amp; China dumping their petrodollar for petroEuro, which they have openly threatened to do if military action takes place, this would be game over for the US economy. Factor in Russian reactions, which recent political events have shown would not be favourable.\n\nIran's infantry number 513,000 active, 350,000 reserves. No ground war? Imagine the Iranian forces streaming across the Iraq border in retaliation and cutting off the only major supply route for the US' relatively tiny &amp; beleaguered forces in Iraq, which is across land from Kuwait (thanks to Rumsfeld's brilliant military mind). It would be another Stalingrad for the US forces, who cannot even contain the broken remnants of Saddam's sadly pathetic Republican Guard &amp; a surly group of rag-tag insurrectionists.\n\nI could go on.\n\nThis piece is nothing but propaganda for Israel trying to shore up flaccid morale in the ultra-right wing Israel-supporting political base. It is biased and highly questionable. \n\nUSA can attack Iran. They won't. Israel may try.
