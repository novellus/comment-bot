Ron Paul is perfectly all right with drilling ANWR.  You don't make money if the *government* drills money.

That's what the state governments are for. \n\nReally?  State governments are more easily influenced by corporations than the Federal government.  A medium sized corporation can threaten a State government to give it benefits under the threat of moving to another state.  Similar cannot be done with the Federal government except by the mega-corporations.  The Federal government doesn't care which State the corporation functions in.\n\n&gt; There is nothing in the Constitution that calls for the federal government to take care of the common man.\n\nThe federal government does have the authority under the United States Code to use force to defend the rights of citizens against state authorities.[source][]\n\n[source]: http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1971----03.htm", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "created_utc": "1192675520", "ups": 13, "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5yim3", "retrieved_on": 1427426157, "score": 13, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c029sr7", "author": "mre5765", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c029sr7", "parent_id": "t1_c029pvt", "body": "&gt; Therefore, that land should be divested as soon as possible to whomever will pay the highest.

This is an amazing amount of spin. Nearly everything you've stated is Ron Paul saying \"The federal government doesn't have a right to say anything in this case.\" For example, the ANWR drilling. He doesn't -WANT- to drill in ANWR; instead, he feels that the federal government doesn't have a right to own land. Therefore, that land should be divested as soon as possible to whomever will pay the highest. In the case of ANWR, that's going to be the oil companies.\n\n&gt; Ron Paul isn't an environmentalist - he's a doctor and a politician. He also feels that the federal government shouldn't be in the business of making unconstitutional decrees. Hence, he doesn't like the CAFE standards. If you like them, please state which of the 17 enumerated powers of Congress allows that body to make them.\n\n&gt; As for hating immigrants, that's completely and utterly false. He wants immigration. He just wants sane immigration. He also wants people to actually recognize that citizenship is a responsibility and a privilege, not a right.\n\n&gt; As for the whole genocide thing ... yes, it's a horrible thing that's happening in the Sudan. And in the Congo. And in Turkey. And in Saudi Arabia. And in Israel. And in Egypt. And in China. And in about another dozen countries in the world. Which set of oppressed people is tenth on the list to save? How long do you plan to deploy troops paid for with my tax dollars to a region where they aren't wanted just to keep someone else safe?\n\n&gt; Libertarians don't want to ignore the world. They simply believe that we should follow the advice set forth in Washington's farewell address - be friends with all nations, but avoid entangling alliances. Extending the hand of free and fair trade will do more to stop violence than anything else. People who are busy making stuff to sell on the world market generally have little time to shoot each other.\n\n&gt; As for caring about Americans ... it's a fantasy that the federal government exists to care about the common man. That's what the state governments are for. The federal government is there to take care of the ... wait for it ... federation. Federation of what? The States! There is nothing in the Constitution that calls for the federal government to take care of the common man. On the contrary, if you read the notes from the 1787 Convention, you'll see that the idea was for the state governments to do so and the federal government to act as a coordinator, arbitrator, and protector-from-outside-evils for the states.\n\n&gt; Please please read the Constitution. It's the document that lays out what the government is and is not allowed to do. You know, in 1994, there was a push to have every bill that was proposed in Congress to cite the enumerated power that allowed for that bill. That was stopped after the first 100 or so bills came up and only 3 were constitutional. That should say something about what our lovely federal government has become. And, more importantly, why it seems like Ron Paul is such a kook for wanting to follow the Constitution. No-one else seems to be doing so.

That sort of thing only works as long as you manage to *improve*  upon the original.   \nRemember that [Hillary 1984](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h3G-lMZxjo)  viral video that an Obama supporter made from the old Apple ad, and then some random Clinton supporter made [another video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dycbAsB9-ps) to bash Obama from the same ad, but it wasn't near as well put together or subtle, and no one thought much of it?\n\nSee, the thing is, bigman11's original post (before he edited it) said \"If there are any real intellectuals at Reddit let me know you exist.\", and so I made the dictionary post in order to suggest, in a fun way, that bigman11 lives in an imaginary world of backwards logic where that 3rd entry to the definition of \"intellectual\" is true, and to illustrate the absurdity of the point of view from that imaginary world in contrast to the real one by also including the actual definitions.\n\nYour reply on the other hand, merely serves either to say \"well, you're a pseudo-intellectual\" (which isn't really a good argument by itself no matter *how* you dress it up unless you give a reason), or even to supplement my point about the imaginary world in which bigman11 (and apparently yourself) reside, where words take sides, and where anyone who would agree with me - even if they were to have a PhD - would be defined as a pseudo-intellectual.\n\nFurthermore; the formatting was off, the language didn't match what you might actually find in a dictionary... You didn't even include the original entries, though to do so would have made your  attempt at rebuttal look even worse. Advice: try never make an argument wherein it's obvious that the inclusion of irrefutable facts would undermine your point.\n\nIn the end, a simplification plays out like this:\n\n**bigman11:** People who like Ron Paul are not intellectuals.  \n**kettlehead:** bigman11 probably has the wrong definition of \"intellectual\"  \n**shuael**: I have the wrong definition of \"pseudo-intellectual\".\n\nBetter luck next time ;)    ", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "parent_id": "t1_c029sjz", "id": "c029stw", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "name": "t1_c029sjz", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "ups": 0, "link_id": "t3_5yim3", "retrieved_on": 1427426160, "id": "c029sjz", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c029s93", "body": "&gt; I'm flattered.\n\nMeanwhile you failed to notice that I also insulted you.\n\nBut I guess it is too much to expect that people who use a standard dictionary format to post and when someone responds in kind possess the intelligence to understand an insult.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 1, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5yim3", "retrieved_on": 1427426164, "id": "c029s93", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "name": "t1_c029s93", "parent_id": "t1_c029s7c", "body": "Well, apparently you thought my format was clever enough to copy.
