That's what the BSD License is for, so you can do whatever the fuck you want with the code.  Apple has not fared badly with using FreeBSD as their base.  And they have played nice with the communities and given changes back.\n\nSecond, you just don't get it.  All their legacy support is what is making their platform so buggy and hard to secure.  Holding on to the past, is, well, hanging on to the past.  And we know what that past is with Windows, month after month of \"Patch Tuesdays\" and still gaping holes big enough to drive a truck through.  Expecting a different result while employing the same practices is, well, insane.  A clean slate is their only salvation.  And they better get busy.  NeXtStep had about 8 years of development under its belt before Apple morphed it into OS X.\n\nAnd don't give me the MS-fanboy-apologist rhetoric that OS X is virus free due to lack of interest.  Write the fucking virus/trojan/malware, then we'll talk.  The reason it is harder to target is because it is UNIX.  A 30 year old operating system, designed from the ground up to run a mission-critical application, the phone system.  Reviewed by more eyeballs than probably any other piece of code.  And OS X is going to stay more secure because of the continued innovation, look for \"Library Randomization\" here: http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/300.html#security\n\nMicrosoft focusing on the Kernel as if it is going to solve their problems is foolish.  Their security risks reside mostly in User-level APIs.  They would do much better to use an off-the-shelf kernel and focus on cleaning up their APIs and applications, because that is where their real problems lie.  I do have to say, it is a nice PR move, and I'm sure it gives all the MS-fanboys a warm fuzzy.  I remember getting all warm and fuzzy when they told us \"no more UAEs\" in Windows 3.1.  Yeah, they just changed the name of \"UAE\".  This is more of the same.\n\nEdit: one more rant and I'm done...\n\nIt is just your typical immature programmer who wants to fix problems in a program by tossing it out altogether and rewriting it from scratch.
