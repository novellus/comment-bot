They tend not to show manners (which is a form of respect) for fear of seing weak or subserviant. I don't know whether this tendancy is genetic or a result of society, but jeez, you think after reaching the top of your profession like Puff Daddy or Shaquille O'Neal, you'd have enough confidence in yourself that you don't have to pick a fight some random punk in a club, and you don't have to smack talk to reporters about other teams. \n\nSo a new question: are blacks to stupid to realize respect, culture and manners are important?", "author": "Lyrad1000", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c02btyx", "parent_id": "t1_c02bs79", "id": "c02btyx", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "ups": 2, "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5za7h", "retrieved_on": 1427425160, "id": "c02bs79", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "name": "t1_c02bs79", "parent_id": "t3_5za7h", "body": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null}
