I left Google at the end of 2004, so of course I'm out of date... Kirkland wasn't open, for example, and Dublin was just techs.\n\nSince you asked, and since you more or less stated you're in the successor to production, I'll hazard a guess that you work on pushing out changes and monitoring the fallout via the performance analysis scripts. (whatever they have metastasized into -- there were 3 completely separate monitoring systems when I was there, and that was while ago)  Again, not a shitload of detail, but Google's tools have changed (probably for the better) and you about as much as said what you're doing.  (I did find it amusing that this is in direct contradiction to some other guy's guess, but then, I'm cheating here)\n\nIt occurs to me that I might somehow be violating an NDA so I'm going to excuse myself now.  But you sound like you're doing the fun stuff if you're in SRE.  \n\nI went back to grad school, although I have to admit that, having sold my hobby site and working full time on my thesis, I sometimes miss what Google used to be.  I don't imagine that it could possibly have stayed as informal and chaotic as it once was, if only because that (flat) model didn't scale well.", "author": "apathy", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c029cu5", "subreddit_id": "t5_2fwo", "name": "t1_c029cu5", "parent_id": "t1_c029crc", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2fwo", "name": "t1_c029crc", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 1, "link_id": "t3_2zl8d", "retrieved_on": 1427426365, "body": "[deleted]", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c029ci2", "id": "c029crc", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "programming", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 1, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_2zl8d", "retrieved_on": 1427426368, "id": "c029ci2", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c029ci2", "parent_id": "t1_c2zvm2", "body": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null}
