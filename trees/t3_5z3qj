This graph is an attempt to chart \"degree of religiosity,\" which is a continuum and a concept very difficult to measure. Looking at the pdf on the Pew site, I found that they are measuring religiosity based on a three-point scale: 1 point if the respondent believes faith in God is necessary for morality, 1 point if they say religion is important in their life, and 1 if they pray everyday.  You could score a zero on that test and not be an atheist per se.  You can consider religion very important in your life but only score a 1.  What might appear to be a higher or lower ratio of atheists to believers might actually be a result of differences in how different cultures and countries think about and practice religion.  It's really hard to know, just looking at the chart.\n\nAside the position of the US on the map, there are also some other interesting things going on.  Look at how Europe lines up.  Both East and West Europe falls below the curve in terms of their religiosity index, but East Europe has a much lower income than West Europe.
