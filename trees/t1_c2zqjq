Thompson school for gun fun.  Guns are fun, no doubt about it.  Owning one, firing one, if you want to hunt that's great, if not that's great, I never understood the desire to sit still for four hours waiting for a deer but hey if that's your thing, I'm glad you have the patience for it.  Which is more than I can say for all guys out there who are too afraid to learn how to use a gun.  Too afraid of what the women in their lives will say.  I say give all the emo boys guns and let the problem sort itself out.  They'll either end themselves or feel empowered.  How's that for self-help  Either way it's win win.  Talk to the local firing range or a friend with a gun.  Shooting at the range is more fun than whining on reddit.
