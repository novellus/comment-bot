Questions of God necessitate questions of our own inner character.\n\n&gt; Nice link on Trofim Lysenko, but thats the first I've read about him and what I read from this wiki entry, is that he is not denying evolution at all, but just the mechanism that genetic traits are inherited. An interesting discussion of evolution, but I think it diverges more than exemplifies anything you're saying.\n\nYeah, that wiki article is fairly sparse. Lysenko's ideas and Stalins husbanding of them are explored in far greater detail in Alan Bullock's books *Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives*. Using the principles of dialectical materialism Stalin and Lysenko 'debunked' classical evolution and repressed it. They did the same to ban the theory of Molecular Orbital Hybridisation. It's wacky stuff. Apparently the sp2 orbital is the enemy of the people.  \n\n&gt; This is where I slightly disagree with you. You just said that atheism has no moral value and essentially is just a stance about god. Therefore, humanism is what should seek to refute falsehoods and not atheism. Correct?\n\nNo, I think there are two moral systems. One that finds all its conclusions about the value of human existence (and all its aspects; pleasure, suffering, etc) derive themselves from a fixed assumption about the nature of the innermost character of a human (this could be a KKK proposition about Caen and Able and the Jews being of the devil, or the enlightened notion that God created all humans equal, and made us the stewards of His creation), and those that do not rely upon an assumption of such a fixed knowledge, but would seek instead to value all life as intrinsically valuable within a greater good. \n\n&gt; Institutions can commit evil, because they were based on a theist belief; yet an institution based on atheistic belief can't commit evil?\n\nAbsolutely, and they have. It is true that when people believe nothing they end up believing anything. Removing God as the explanation for people's innermost character created a vacuum that simply ended up being filled by the notion that environment determines consciousness and so therefore there is no real innermost character of any importance to the prescribed social order; however, heaven/hell and doctrinal theory are still present in that case. And Marx-Hegelism was atheistic purely because it sought to create the social order for a utopia, as opposed to a heaven after death. Both required people to be changed from without, and both were directly competitive with one another. Democracy, humanism and secularism are not *at heart* competitive with religious belief, and I am saddened that the intensity and hysteria of our times has changed the mood of the debate to the point where evolutionists and atheists have fallen into the trap of...well, some of them are beginning to sound a little like they're proselytizing. Where they should be promulgating the principles of critical thinking that underly their work, they are starting to promulgate the conclusions of their work. They are not very humble. \n\nMind you, humanism and secularism are relatively new, and I wouldn't write them off based on the fervour of a few evolutionary bioloigist atheists who find personal meaning in doing what they do. They're human too.

Thats not fair.\n\nInstitutions can commit evil, because they were based on a theist belief; yet an institution based on atheistic belief can't commit evil? \n\n&gt; environment determines consciousness\n\nthis is a good point. I see what you've developed now. You're saying that the institutions, such as the inquisition, were built on religion and the marxist institutions weren't built on atheism, but something else entirely. Therefore you can't blame atheism for the failures of the marxist system. \n\nYour point is well argued here and I think this does in fact vindicate atheism from the negative connotation of Stalinism and Maoism. I'm not even sure I saw this train of logic used to argue this point and I will actually use it myself, however...\n\nWhat can you blame then for their atrocities? You've said that Marx himself would blame \"outside influence\" for corrupting the perfect system, but you haven't yourself offered your own explanation.\n\nI think you're going to say humanism was their failure.

I mean, Dawkins is an evolutionary biologist, and yet Stalin and Trofim Lysenko used dialectical materialism to deny evolution. \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trofim_Lysenko\n\nFurthermore, whilst I would say that atheism has no moral value, secularism and humanism do. \n\nSo, whilst making the statement 'christianity has committed evil' is a statement inherently fraught with the vagaries of what exactly constitutes Christianity, one can say that historical institutions for which christianity was the central inspiration have. The same cannot be said of atheism I believe, because whilst Marx might have incorporated atheism categorically into his theories, the very origins of Marxs ideas sprang from the self-same flaw in the philosophies of social order that underpin organised religion; ie, that free will or no, it is the duty of a prescribed social order to 'perfect' people's innermost character so as to achieve heaven/utopia and avoid hell/das capital - central to all Marxist thinking is the pivotal idea that *environment determines consciousness*, therefore it left only to an outside body of theorems to construct the correct environment, and similarly, hard-line Christians (and moralists of all varieties) favour the assumption that all indecencies seek absolute domination of a soul, and must for the sake of the young be heavily repressed, and put out of sight, they are the work of Devil. Just as Marxist theory provides the excuse that all short-comings of any socialist system will be the result of some outside capitalist influence. \n\nThis is where, IMO, atheism differs most basically. By not presupposing God, or any forgone conclusions about the essential nature of a human, it avoids this. That atheism could be twisted to other ends is no more surprising or detrimental to its integrity than Stalin and Lysenko's ability to propound Lamarckism from so-called research is to the integrity of the theory of evolution.\n\nThat being said, I reiterate, atheism is of no real value morally. Rather, it seeks to disrepresent exactly those falsehoods that lie at the heart of any presuppositions made about the innermost character of a human.

Thats very generous of you and most people try to argue that atheism never does wrong.\n\n&gt; how is arguing the negative effects of theism ...They're very different fears.\n\nI don't dispute the differences, but you said that atheists don't use fear to try to convert people. Hitchens, Dwarkins and Harris all use fear to persuade people away from religion. I'm only partway through Dennitt's book and he argues more of a neutral position so far, but I suspect he'll get around to saying the direct negative effects of religion, which are given a negative light and made into something to be feared.\n\nSo I use this to refute the claim that atheists don't try to de-convert people with the use of fear. A real world fear as opposed to a fictional fear, but fear none-the-less.\n\n&gt; In the quiet words of the Virgin Mary, come again?\n\nhehehe, I never heard that before! I think the \"quiet\" isn't the best way to phrase it though, it seems to distract from the punchline a bit.\n\n&gt; Believing in atheism isn't going to make a person good, but if believing in christianity made people good, those untransformed by it are dismissed for not-being-real christians. \n\nI agree, I think this is the irrationality of theism. They dismiss the evil acts as not being part of their \"true\" religion. \n\nI think this is what I was countering you with, that atheists dismiss stalin as not being part of the \"true\" atheism.\n\nI think your thoughts on the subject are directly to the point. If you truly dismiss the christian link to the inquisition, then christians wouldn't be able to point to stalin either, since its the same comparison.\n\nHowever, if this is your stance, then you really can't claim anything evil being done by christianity, can you?

Many authors and other atheistic proponents talk of the negative effects that theism has.

I call foul on this concept.\n\nIf Stalin exploited the religious infrastructure to promote Stalin himself to the role of God, as Hitchens explains, then atheism can't argue its not a religion then. Its like saying, sorry we're not a religion and if we did anything bad, it was religions fault and not ours.\n\n&gt; Quit with the atheism is a way of life crap. It's simply an intellectual point of view. \n\nThis is really a separate argument in itself. I think this one is posed by Harris though.\n\nHe argues that atheism is a not believing in something and it would be like discussing the non-astrology position. He says that since there is no word for non-astrology believers, that there should be a word for the non-theist believers as well.\n\nI disagree with this though, in that the majority of atheists believe in a scientific approach to religion. Most atheists will argue that science has not proved God exists and that is why they don't believe in him. If science was to prove God existed, they would then cease to be atheists and then become theists.\n\nSo while you're correct that atheism is only an intellectual point of view, the majority of people claiming to be atheists are applying more than a viewpoint to the whole debate. They apply a critical thinking component, which  is not theist or atheist by   default. \n\nMy point being that they're only atheists for the moment and that could change any minute as new evidence arrives. When that evidence arrives (in theory) they will all shift and yet a few people will remain as atheists despite the evidence.

Theology and doctrine have changed a great deal through history.  Try comparing the views of a 1st C. Christian, a 4th C. Orthodox Christian, an 11th C. Catholic, a 15th C. Byzantine Orthodox Christian, a 17th C. Lutheran, an 18th C. Unitarian, and a 20th C. Babtist.

In the last 300 years that various sorts of atheism have grown popular there has been a sickening amount violence perpetrated by atheists in the name of atheistic worldviews, the scope and frequency make Christianity look trivial in comparison.  You'd could also go arguing for Unitarianism, Jainism, Baha'i, the Society of Friends, or other religions that have never committed violence or had wars fought in their name, but I bet you wouldn't think that was a great thing.\n\n&gt;And you can't argue against it, because there's always the trump card of 'faith' to end any argument.\n\nThe term \"faith\" has had many and various meanings through the history of Christianity and between sects, so you should be more careful with the term.

China and Cambodia were driven to their excesses of murdering, torturing, and raping Buddhists (and any other intellectual dissenters) under Marxist regimes.  Marxism is a complete philosophical system predicated fundamentally on a philosophical materialism, which Marx held to be necessarily atheistic (he's using Hegelian thought so he says he's beyond both thesim and atheism, but where he lands is what any normal person would call atheism).  \n\nThe movement of Marx' thought begins with the Hegelian ideas of evolution applied to history. Where Marx broke with Hegel was that Hegel viewed the movement of history as a dialectic which was an expression of the spirit of God moving through history. In his Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right, Marx explained that, \"the criticism of religion is the prerequisite of all criticism.\" Religion and the idea of God must necessarily be rejected, \"The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness...\" \"Thus, the criticism of Heaven turns into the criticism of Earth, the criticism of religion into the criticism of law, and the criticism of theology into the criticism of politics.\" Having rejected theistic thinking, he moves to a reductionist position where materialism and economics are regarded as the *real* moving factors in history. Society must be transformed to reject all notions of God (and all religions), and moved through its next logical steps to Communism. Without the principle of of an atheistic materialism, Communism could not be. Marxism is at its root an atheistic materialist approach to transforming society.  It's not the only atheistic approach to politics (thank God :)), nor is it the necessary result, but the particular atrocities were perpetrated by atheists and the persecuted were persecuted for not being such.   \n\n[added]\n\nIt's a useful reminder that no matter what worldview a person may hold (including Buddhism, atheism, Christianity, and any other -ism), given political power and time, they can readily turn that view towards depraved ends.  Marxism was supposed to be about helping the poor and oppressed.  I believe we should try to remind ourselves that no matter how lofty our ideals sound, that if our goals deviate from treating others with kindness and compassion, we are doing something wrong.

Can you even name one?\n\nThe reason I cited the ethics survey book, is because it precisely shows how modern Western ethics evolved directly from the biblical moral model. Would you discard Kant? Aquinas? Would you discard the foundations of Western ethical thought?\n\nApparently you don't believe in symbiosis either? I'm not sure how you digest your food, maybe the bacteria in your stomach doesn't exist. \n\nIs it possible that religion exists symbiotically within the culture that observes it.

I think we can.\n\nCan we apply modern thought to the texts of the Christian religion, and the various sub-groups of people who claim to be observing a Christian belief, and compare the two across each of these populations. I think this is also a no brainier. \n\nAnd the beauty is we can apply all the tools of modern sociology to this process.\n\nYour argument, and the section of the author's argument that you have highlighted boils down to, a belief in clearly being able to describe the sociological phenomena of the Christian religion, but yet not be able to get any handle on measuring it, categorizing it, or comparing it to variation of itself or other religions. How can this be? How can some human activity exist that can be described and yet not measured?

What is it? A church? Certain passages? Whatever-smacfarl-says? \n\nI'll admit that there is one possible metric. Religion could change from being based on superstitiously-arrived-at and dogmatically-maintined axioms, with no clear and generally-agreed-upon rules of dialogue, to being a discourse based on evidence, open to revision. \n\nProblem is, on that metric \u2013 which ultimately is the only one that deserves any respect in the modern world \u2013 religion, including the be-good-because-Jesus-says-so kind of religion, can only be deconstructed away into humanism.

Viruses stay with us too, you know...\n\nSo this is an interesting argument, but usually those viruses that stay with us engage in some type of symbiosis. Which is certainly what I am arguing here.\n\nSo if we look at the study of ethics for example the compact survey text [*Moral Philosophy through the Ages* by James Fieser](http://www.amazon.com/Moral-Philosophy-Through-James-Fieser/dp/0767412982/) we can clearly see that the search for a non-divine inspired codex that resembles the best features of the Bible has been going on for centuries. And really it's not very surprising that many of the great Moral Philosophers would look for examples, from those things in society that have demonstratively been working, from which to build on. And many give much more reasoned arguments than those presented by the author, and higlighted above.\n\nHow shall we determine the true Christianity from the false? Is it the authority of the Church? (Then which church?) Or the Bible? (Then which canon, which version, and which parts?) The inward light of the Quakers, the reason of the Socinians, etc.? (Then according to whom?)\n\nAnd so we see your assumption of the impossibility of this task assumes there is no possible metric, because apparently we have reached some kind of Godel like paradox. We can apparently define what the religion is to inveigle against it, but somehow we can't use or conceive of any metrics to analyze it's structure. Sorry no. \n\nFrom a sociological point of view we can most certainly do textual analysis, sociological studies of group behavior, as well as applying the vast array of tools available to the modern thinker to open the box and figure out pretty nearly what is the intention behind the religion as well as figuring out to what degree which sub-groups of the total population that declare their observation of it, practice it.  \n\nWhich is exactly why claiming a study of what is Christianity or any other religion for that matter is both possible and necessary for dealing with the consequence of the practices of those religions. Hence the lack of validity of her position that such things aren't possible, and her strange stance that she is angry at people who try.\n\nIs it not possible to analyze and study culture and religion in general? Sociology has been trying to do this since it's founding in the late 19th century, mainly in the context of native peoples all over the world.\n\nI think the sections you have highlighted are actually a poorly thought out distraction from the rest of the passage, which highlights many of the concerns I tried to address in my initial response.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 1, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5yecn", "retrieved_on": 1427426248, "id": "c029lrj", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "name": "t1_c029lrj", "parent_id": "t1_c029jyr", "body": "  Ethics?

Surely even a rudimentary application of evolution in a sociological perspective relative to the societies that perpetuate religious beliefs including the Christian ones, indicate there are some positive results.

We examine both difference and similarities, this is the essence of not just modern science but common sense.\n\n&gt;I don't think any of you have it right. To me, it all looks like something that people just made up.\n\nSo according to the author, none of the belief systems of the world have any value at all. Perhaps all societal successes within these belief systems are somehow accidental? Thousands of years of human progress and apparently none of it came from any religious insight anywhere! Not a remotely defensible view.\n\n&gt;How the hell do they know which parts of the Bible/ Torah/ Koran/ Bhagavad-Gita/ whatever God really meant, and which parts he didn't?\n\nSo this assumes an equivalence. There is no equivalence between these texts, they are not the same and they do not have remotely the same origins. According to the author's previous statements all of these religions must be equally wrong. However there is no equally itemized condemnation of Muslims, Hebrews, or Buddhists, all of which in areas of dominance have equally fervent believers. Rather her ire is directed uniquely at Christians and particularly the red fabric used by this administration, which is designed to invite exactly this kind of attack. Hence my invitation to examine the structural problems related to the vast majority of her complaints, rather than just retreating to a lazy blanket condemnations. Sure some of these religions occasionally get an check off in the also ran category as indicated in the other cited paragraph, but no serious examination has been done in this essay.\n\n&gt;And if they don't know, if they're just basing it on their own moral instincts and their own perceptions of the world, then on what basis are they thinking that God and their sacred texts have anything to do with it at all?\n\nSo I think we have to look at the societal successes that organize religions yield the world over. Not a hard case to make. If they didn't provide some societal benefits, there would be no religions. Thousands of years of social evolution have not washed them out.

But sometimes religion merely consists of the appeasement of a malevolent and jealous god, and sometimes does not even claim otherwise. Ethics, justice, charity and virtue are not the core of all religion, though it is particularly common to consider them so in Christianity (as well as in systems like Taoism and Buddhism which are more philosophic than they are theological and may only dubiously be termed religion).  Gods have been associated with all aspects of the human experience, but moral teaching is merely one of them, and in some systems it's simply absent from theology (Odin and Zeus are not your ethical standard bearers).  I would like to be glad of religious concern for the pursuit of an ethical existence, but the record of religious success in facilitating the realisation of ethical goals in civil society is not a particularly good one, and I suppose that, when all is said and done, I find it impossible to imagine that common sense would have had a poorer run than faith has had, in the same role.

Such evil must be purged from Israel.  (Deuteronomy 17:12 NLT)\n\n\nKill Homosexuals\n    \"If a man lies with a male as with a women, both of them shall be put to death for their abominable deed; they have forfeited their lives.\"  (Leviticus 20:13 NAB)\n\n Death for Hitting Dad\n\n    Whoever strikes his father or mother shall be put to death.  (Exodus 21:15 NAB)\n\nDeath for Cursing Parents\n\n    1) If one curses his father or mother, his lamp will go out at the coming of darkness.  (Proverbs 20:20 NAB)\n\n    2) All who curse their father or mother must be put to death.  They are guilty of a capital offense.  (Leviticus 20:9 NLT)\n\n \n\nDeath for Adultery\n\n    If a man commits adultery with another man's wife, both the man and the woman must be put to death.  (Leviticus 20:10 NLT)\n\nDeath to Followers of Other Religions\n\n    Whoever sacrifices to any god, except the Lord alone, shall be doomed.  (Exodus 22:19 NAB)\n\nKill Nonbelievers\n\n    They entered into a covenant to seek the Lord, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and soul; and everyone who would not seek the Lord, the God of Israel, was to be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.  (2 Chronicles 15:12-13 NAB)\n\n \n\nKill False Prophets\n\n    If a man still prophesies, his parents, father and mother, shall say to him, \"You shall not live, because you have spoken a lie in the name of the Lord.\"  When he prophesies, his parents, father and mother, shall thrust him through.  (Zechariah 13:3 NAB)\n\nKill Women Who Are Not Virgins On Their Wedding Night\n\n    But if this charge is true (that she wasn't a virgin on her wedding night), and evidence of the girls virginity is not found, they shall bring the girl to the entrance of her fathers house and there her townsman shall stone her to death, because she committed a crime against Israel by her unchasteness in her father's house.  Thus shall you purge the evil from your midst.  (Deuteronomy  22:20-21 NAB)\n\nKill Followers of Other Religions.\n\n    1) If your own full brother, or your son or daughter, or your beloved wife, or you intimate friend, entices you secretly to serve other gods, whom you and your fathers have not known, gods of any other nations, near at hand or far away, from one end of the earth to the other: do not yield to him or listen to him, nor look with pity upon him, to spare or shield him, but kill him.  Your hand shall be the first raised to slay him; the rest of the people shall join in with you.  You shall stone him to death, because he sought to lead you astray from the Lord, your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that place of slavery.  And all Israel, hearing of this, shall fear and never do such evil as this in your midst.  (Deuteronomy 13:7-12 NAB)\nInfidels and Gays Should Die\n\n    So God let them go ahead and do whatever shameful things their hearts desired.  As a result, they did vile and degrading things with each other's bodies.  Instead of believing what they knew was the truth about God, they deliberately chose to believe lies.  So they worshiped the things God made but not the Creator himself, who is to be praised forever.  Amen.  That is why God abandoned them to their shameful desires.  Even the women turned against the natural way to have sex and instead indulged in sex with each other.  And the men, instead of having normal sexual relationships with women, burned with lust for each other.  Men did shameful things with other men and, as a result, suffered within themselves the penalty they so richly deserved.  When they refused to acknowledge God, he abandoned them to their evil minds and let them do things that should never be done.  Their lives became full of every kind of wickedness, sin, greed, hate, envy, murder, fighting, deception, malicious behavior, and gossip.  They are backstabbers, haters of God, insolent, proud, and boastful.  They are forever inventing new ways of sinning and are disobedient to their parents.  They refuse to understand, break their promises, and are heartless and unforgiving.  They are fully aware of God's death penalty for those who do these things, yet they go right ahead and do them anyway.  And, worse yet, they encourage others to do them, too.  (Romans 1:24-32 NLT)\n\n \n\nKill Anyone who Approaches the Tabernacle\n\n    For the LORD had said to Moses, 'Exempt the tribe of Levi from the census; do not include them when you count the rest of the Israelites.  You must put the Levites in charge of the Tabernacle of the Covenant, along with its furnishings and equipment.  They must carry the Tabernacle and its equipment as you travel, and they must care for it and camp around it.  Whenever the Tabernacle is moved, the Levites will take it down and set it up again.  Anyone else who goes too near the Tabernacle will be executed.'  (Numbers 1:48-51 NLT)\n\n \n\nKill People for Working on the Sabbath\n\n    The LORD then gave these further instructions to Moses: 'Tell the people of Israel to keep my Sabbath day, for the Sabbath is a sign of the covenant between me and you forever.  It helps you to remember that I am the LORD, who makes you holy.  Yes, keep the Sabbath day, for it is holy.  Anyone who desecrates it must die; anyone who works on that day will be cut off from the community.  Work six days only, but the seventh day must be a day of total rest.  I repeat: Because the LORD considers it a holy day, anyone who works on the Sabbath must be put to death.'  (Exodus 31:12-15 NLT)\n\n\nYou forget, \"Thou shalt not kill\" is negotiable. Thou shalt not kill is more of something to do within your tribe. It's okay to kill people who don't believe the same thing as you.\n\nAnyway, all those things above are from the Old Testament. Some Christians say Jesus took care of this and does away with the Old Testament, WRONG. \nLooky at what Jebus says:\n1) \u201cFor truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass the law until all is accomplished.  Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\u201d  (Matthew 5:18-19 RSV)  Clearly the Old Testament is to be abided by until the end of human existence itself.  None other then Jesus said so.\n\n2) All of the vicious Old Testament laws will be binding forever.  \"It is easier for Heaven and Earth to pass away than for the smallest part of the letter of the law to become invalid.\"  (Luke 16:17 NAB)\n\n3) Jesus strongly approves of the law and the prophets.  He hasn\u2019t the slightest objection to the cruelties of the Old Testament.  \"Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets.  I have come not to abolish but to fulfill.  Amen, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest part or the smallest part of a letter will pass from the law, until all things have taken place.\"  (Matthew 5:17 NAB)\n\n3b) \"All scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for refutation, for correction, and for training in righteousness...\"  (2 Timothy 3:16 NAB)\n\n3c) \"Know this first of all, that there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.\" (2 Peter 20-21 NAB)\n\n4) Jesus criticizes the Jews for not killing their disobedient children according to Old Testament law.  Mark.7:9-13  \"Whoever curses father or mother shall die\"  (Mark 7:10 NAB)\n\nAnd MORE such tings.\n\n\nAll this from www.evilbible.com", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c029imi", "id": "c029ion", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "archived": true, "ups": -1, "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5yecn", "retrieved_on": 1427426288, "score": -1, "body": "You may be an atheist, but you sure as hell are an ignorant one.

He said to her, \"Get up; let's go.\" But there was no answer. Then the man put her on his donkey and set out for home.

I meant to say, from my perspective as a Christian, this is what true religion is. I paraphrased James 1:26-27 (NIV) which says, \"26If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless. 27Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.\" \n\nI hear what you say, though. Everyone thinks that their religion is the only true religion, their faith is the only true faith. I am not trying to justify anything by what I am about to say. I just think that I need to say it. \n\nPeople do a lot of bad stuff in the name of religion and in the name of God. Other people like to look at that and use it as a justification to blame God. And to be honest, Christians don't do a lot to counteract that belief. I am sure you have heard of the people who bomb abortion clinics, or go out and shoot a person who is homosexual, and say that God told them to do it. When I hear of stuff like that, I am almost ashamed to call myself a Christian. Are people going to think that I do that, or that I agree with that? I absolutely do not! What I believe in is hope. I know a lot of people think that it is a false hope. What I am trying to say is, and this is my belief, that God gave us free will, to do good to others, or to royally screw up everything that we touch.\n\nIt is not my goal to try and convert anybody here, or to say that my religion is the best. Of course it is my religion, and I hold to my beliefs very strongly, even people do bad things, and claim to believe the same things I do. Sure I can say that they are not \"true Christians.\" But then I would just be adding to the anger of the author of this article. I don't claim to know all the answers. I don't even claim to be right. But I make no apologies for what I believe, and that is to show the love that Jesus preached. \n\n(I also no not mean to offend anybody. I am sorry about how I worded that \"true religion.\" I am sorry if I have offended anybody, that was not my intent. I am not a very eloquent typer, and I might have worded something wrong.

We atheists, are not more rational than those \"true religion is helping and loving others.\" kind of Christians. Yes, we lack the belief of afterlife and stuff, but we still get our inner motivations from mixture of genes, childhood traumas and just thin air. You might think that we have at least more personal freedom to figure out our way in life, but I can not see that. My experience with myself and other atheists tells me that they have at least as much irrational beliefs and brain farts as \"Good is love liberal Christians\". This atheist irrational behavior is wrapped up into rationalization and science speak. Rationalism and scientific world view is just is whatever a person says it is to them. On bigger scale, society or scientific community, there can be some deep rational undercurrent. But single individuals are just as irrational as mellow Christians. \n \n\nGood example of this is Richard Dawkins. See: \n[Beyond Demonic Memes -\nWhy Richard Dawkins is Wrong About Religion\nby David Sloan Wilson ](http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/07-07-04.html) , or [J. Watson on race, sex, homosexuality](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article2677098.ece?token=null&amp;offset=12) \n\nAtheism does not make one more rational. It just takes out one psychological protection mechanism. We just replace religion with something else to cover up our neurosis. It used to be communism, today it may be singularity, escapism, etc. I think religion is generally bad thing, but I see it more as symptom than sickness. Our mind is kludge.
