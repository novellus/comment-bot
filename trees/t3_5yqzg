The kind of pressure matters.  For instance, I strongly support the activists that are pressuring Chevron to pull out of Myanmar.  But, IMO, that's pressure on an *American* corporation.  Similarly in the case of South Africa, it was pressure on *American* corporations to cease relations with the country.  You didn't have black people sending photos of them hugging white people (which would surely have infuriated the racists in South Africa).\n\nOffending or angering the military from the *outside* isn't aiding the people.  It will only increase the repression by the military who have all mechanisms of force under their control.\n\n&gt; an example which pits the US against popular nationalism. In this case, Burmese popular opinion is tilted against the junta. The foreigners are supporting a popular movement.\n\nWhat you're saying is that in the case of Turkey a majority of the population do not wish to be reminded that they were responsible for the massacre of Armenians whereas most Myanmarese do want the military ousted.\n\nThat is absolutely accurate.  But I am just not convinced that sending your soiled panties to a brutal dictatorship (or military) helps in any way.  By our cultural standards it is offensive, and I'm willing to guess, that it is offensive by their standards too.
