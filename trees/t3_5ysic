What a collection of hypocrisies! The remedy sought in the law suit charging fraud is negated by destruction of evidence by the people accused of election fraud.  And then, that crime, destruction of evidence, is dismissed by Democrats who were elected on a promise to go after 2004 election fraud.  We've reached a limit of nonsense that can be tolerated.  Nobody will give up on this until the truth is told and the crimes are investigated (which was the purpose of the law suit in the first place).  Thanks!
