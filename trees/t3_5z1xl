I believe in low taxes, no property taxes, deportation of illegal immigrants, border enforcement and respect for authority unless betrayed by those authorities. I also believe everyone deserves health care, decent food, and shelter, regardless of their income. I also think what one's religious beliefs or lack there of are nobody else's business unless they infringe upon another person's legal beliefs and I don't trust people who wear their religion on their sleeve or use their religion to preach how you should also believe what they believe.
