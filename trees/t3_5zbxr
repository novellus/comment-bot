Eclipse is built on SWT, which is a GUI library not developed by apple anyway, IDEA and NetBeans run on swing, but new look and feels (like nimbus) can easily be built on top of plain cocoa. Running 'server' apps (java's mainstay anyway) just requires a unixy command line which mac os x has always had, which leaves:\n\nmac-look-and-feel java apps. You can currently more or less do this on Tiger. There's even a guide on apple.com about how to get the details right, such as a preferences and about menu in the right place, and the resize thingie in the bottom-right. However, I don't run any of those apps and I don't know of any either. So those will pretty much be off the table if the main JVM for apples is no longer produced by apple itself.

I grok that apple prefers ObjC developers (but see my footnote on that), but why does Apple get all happy and excited if Joe Q. Random Mac User so happends to use 'ruby' instead of 'jruby' to run the same code anyway? You're just putting that out there with not one iota of factual basis, or even conjecture.\n\nAs far as ObjC is concerned: Have you actually developed an app with Objective C? It is quite capable of fighting the good fight on its own. The Recent Apple is not normally too concerned with actively locking other systems out* - they will gladly waltz over competitors because their products are just better. If you want to make mac applications that look and feel like a mac, use ObjC. It's easy to learn, and developing in it is great. You can't beat it, not with java, not with ruby, not with anything else.\n\n*) iTMS DRM isn't an exception here. You just can't keep a DRM both secure and easy to use if it's designed/used by a consortium, period. They could certainly put more pressure on keeping this DRM around instead of lightly pushing towards more unencumbered music if they wanted to force the iPod onto the world with pure monopoly weight.\n", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02bxsk", "id": "c02bymg", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "programming", "name": "t1_c02bxsk", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": -3, "link_id": "t3_5zbxr", "retrieved_on": 1427425089, "body": "  Right I see what you're saying.
