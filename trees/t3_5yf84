Thank you for taking the time for such a lengthy and thoughtful series of responses. I was actually thinking of this discussion the two of us are having earlier tonight as I slowly walked away from a speech by one of the authors of [Break Through: From the Death of Environmentalism to the Politics of Possibility ](http://www.amazon.com/Break-Through-Environmentalism-Politics-Possibility/dp/0618658254/ref=sr_1_1/104-2499225-1961556?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1192668204&amp;sr=8-1). \r\n\r\nI think you and Al Gore would like this guy's basic premises, suggestions and arguments. (And I mean that in the most sincere, non-snarky way.) Essentially, his position is that the politics of doom, gloom, disaster and despair will never fix the problem of global warming. He suggests that the fundamental problem of environmentalism to date has been a plethora of aramagedon scenarios berift of solutions. He advocates encouraging big business to make megabucks solving the problem, ... even if individuals in the corporations don't agree with the whole concept of global warming, but only understand it as a way to make a profit. Actually, rather than badly try to paraphrase him, I'll let you look into it to draw conclusions. I didn't have enough cash with me to buy one of the books available tonight, but I think I'll order it either as a book or audio CD.\r\n\r\nIncidently, if you should read that Amazon bio on Shellenberger and then try to click on the link to his organization, I think the Amazon link is wrong. That goes to a breast cancer institute. Shell's co is [here at Thebreakthrough.org](http://www.thebreakthrough.org/)\r\n\r\nHe makes some valid points. I think he misses a lot in terms of the implications of finite resources and is maybe a bit naive about what happens when you dangle large amounts of government subsidies in front of people in a cap and trade type arrangement. \r\n\r\nOK, onto your comments. Yup, I'm a cynic. (And a curmudgeon, and an asshole, too.)\r\n\r\nCoffee- If anyone needs proof that one can be extremely concerned with the environment and yet still have quite a penchant for imported beans, that would be me. Yeah, that Consumer Consequences thingee has it's flaws. For instance, if you live alone, even in a very modest apt or townhouse, or if you commute much at all it dings you pretty hard, even if you drive a high mileage gassaver. I think the main point is to get people aware of a series of interconnected problems like how far our food is shipped, as well as more traditional energy conservation measures.

But I think it's important not to confuse cynicism with a clear-eyed view of the world.\n\nYour argument that \"if everyone bought carbon offsets, the system wouldn't work\" only flies if you assume that the financial incentive to reduce one's carbon emissions wouldn't grow substantially.  \n\nThe problem with Al Gore's behavior is that he is not able to solve the problem he is agitating about, and he is not willing to give up the comforts of his life in order to still not solve the problem he is trying to solve.  As far as I am concerned, this is a fake issue.  It is possible to drink tons of coffee - which the Consumer Consequences Quiz identifies as a significant contributor to climate change - and still be trying to save the environment.\n\nThe problem we face is not that we do not know any way to stop carbon emissions.  Mass genocide, a reversion to an agricultural society, the reversal of globalization, the banning of automobiles - all of these measures would surpass the goals of Kyoto by far.\n\nThe problem that Gore and others who are trying to come up with policies to fix this problem are dealing with is how to reduce carbon emissions without asking everyone to give up too much of the joys and comforts in their lives.  \n\nYou act as if it is impossible to own a mansion and want to reduce carbon emissions.  And I see the conflict there - it is clear.  But the conflict to me is not in the fact that Al Gore owns a mansion, but that despite taking numerous measures to reduce his own carbon emissions, he still is producing a significant amount.  This is not simply Al Gore's problem.  It is our society's and world community's problem.  Would we be complaining about his energy usage if his energy was provided by a nuclear power plant?  Should he stay home instead of flying to give his presentation because staying home will have less of an environmental impact?  That argument has been made as well.  \n\nHis personal actions do nothing but support the measures he believes will be able to halt  climate change.  He believes in innovation, free markets, and public policy.  He is supporting innovation and free markets with his carbon offsets, and purchasing what measures he can to reduce the energy his house uses; I'm sure he's also invested in something to combat climate change; he's also supported the policies of different businesses whose board he is on to reduce emissions.  And he is traveling around the world, making a movie, etcetera in order to try to change public opinion and public policy regarding this issue.\n\nYou can take the position that Al Gore would serve his cause better by living in a medium-sized house and only campaigning about climate change locally (within biking distance).

But on its face, it does prevent a challenge.  Let's put aside Gore's explanation that the house was in his family, that he purchases carbon offsets to diminish his carbon emissions, or that he has taken quite a number of steps to reduce the emissions created as a result of his house.\n\nYour point is that if he tore down the mansion and put in a more modest residence it would reduce the carbon emissions.  Or if he moved to a more modest house, his personal carbon emissions would be reduced even if the overall emissions would remain constant.  And you're right on each count.\n\nBut you're assuming something that Al Gore does not.  You assume that he believes climate change can be solved by reducing our consumption or by private initiative.  While clearly, he believes climate change will be solved by government action, innovation, and free enterprise.  And he is doing what he can to get this process started and to keep it going.  Al Gore does not believe that we need to reduce the amount of power we consume, that we need to radically change our lifestyles, but that we need to reduce the amount of carbon emissions from the power we use, or when possible, use less.\n\nAl Gore is not a hypocrite.  He just has different ideas about how to solve these problems.  As far as his own personal responsibility for his carbon footprint goes, he believes he must take what reasonable measures he can to reduce it.  That doesn't mean selling his family's mansion though.  You can quibble with the decision, and debate where he draws the line, but Al Gore is not a fraud or a hypocrite because he is not advocating for anyone else what he himself is not doing.\n\nI think Al Gore is a good man because he handled defeat with dignity, because he appears to have principles that animate his thinking and public statements, because his judgment remained unbowed by the humiliation of the 2000 election loss, and because he was still willing to put himself out there and try to change the world for the better after this loss.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "ups": 1, "name": "t1_c029if0", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5yf84", "retrieved_on": 1427426292, "score_hidden": false, "body": "I don't necessarily think politics is meaningless.
