For instance, there is this, from that article:\n\n&gt;Chomsky: \" If it were true that the consequences of not using terror would be that the peasantry in Vietnam would continue to live in the state of the peasantry of the Philippines, then I think the use of terror would be justified. \"\n\n&gt; Keith Windschuttle (author): It was not only Chomsky who was sucked into supporting the maelstrom of violence that characterized the communist takeovers in South-East Asia. Almost the whole of the 1960s New Left followed. They opposed the American side and turned Ho Chi Minh and the Vietcong into romantic heroes. \n\n&gt;When the Khmer Rouge took over Cambodia in 1975 both Chomsky and the New Left welcomed it. And when news emerged of the extraordinary event that immediately followed, the complete evacuation of the capital Phnom Penh accompanied by reports of widespread killings, Chomsky offered a rationalization similar to those he had provided for the terror in China and Vietnam: there might have been some violence, but this was understandable under conditions of regime change and social revolution.\n\nKhmer Rouge -- *some violence*? *understandable*?", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02bzl8", "id": "c02bzmz", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "ups": 4, "name": "t1_c02bzl8", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5zd5v", "retrieved_on": 1427425066, "score_hidden": false, "body": "I read the article, and I fail to see how Chomsky is a hypocrite.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5zd5v", "id": "c02bzl8", "author_flair_css_class": null}
