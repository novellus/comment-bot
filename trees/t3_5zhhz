I would love to see you prove this.  I'm pretty sure I know your reasoning for saying this, and you couldn't prove it if your life depended on it.  Even if some Ashkenazis are descendents from converts, I don't know why you think all of them are.  Not to mention that many if not all are genetically Jewish.  This assuming that your ridiculous assumptions are even true, which they aren't.\n\nZionism doesn't mean what all of you seem to think it means.  Zionism simply means being pro a country for the Jewish people. Nothing else.  Whatever other meaning you add to that is a manipulation of the proper definition.  It doesn't mean world domination, it doesn't mean regional hegemony, it simply means being for the Jews having their own country in Israel. THAT IS IT.  Jews who live in Israel as Israeli citizens are Zionists by definition.  Unless they wish to see the country fall, they would be considered Zionists.  Not by your crazy definition, but by the ACTUAL definition.\n\nThe statement about Orthodox Jews is a gross generalization.  Orthodox Jews can be further subdivided into many more specific and distinct groups.  Some of which don't believe that Israel should exist (for the reasons stated above relating to the messiah)  and others that don't share that view.  More importantly, who cares what they think?  Why are they the final arbiters of what Jews can or cannot do.  Are they the majority of the Jewish population? NO. Are they the most ancient? NO.  Some orthodox believe that the holocaust was the Jews own fault, and that god punished them.  The fact is that their mindset is simply a religious one.  Not a moral or ethical based one.  It is funny to me that on a website so firmly grounded against faith, a completely religiously based argument is given so much credence.\n\nAlso, how are the Ashkenazi inbred.  If the Sephardic are the true Jews according to this \"genius\" theory, wouldn't they be more inbred.  Since the Ashkenazis are impostor Jews and of mixed blood, wouldn't they actually carry more genetic diversity.  Do you actually think these retarded arguments through before you spit them back out?\n\nI could go on and on.
