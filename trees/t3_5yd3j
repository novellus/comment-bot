I don't think anyone ever wants to sink, never mind conditions.  Maybe you mean if so much piss code being written, I am or should be afraid of sinking?  I'm not afraid.\n\n&gt; And keep your mouth shut. And your eyes, too.\n\nI don't.  Never have and never will.\n\nI generally don't make big waves.  When left alone I am quiet and harmless.

Once or three times a day.  As long as it takes.  If I get tired, I stop talking, but not because I am afraid or because I believe I should stop.  I just take a break and when I am full of new energy I talk again.\n\nI'm not worried about any negative consequences.  So far the outcome of my behavior has been extremely positive.  People know that when I complain I love em (and it's not pretend love either, we go to lunch together, exchange gifts on occasion, hang out together, basically friends).  They don't like to hear me complain, but at the same time they know I am super-unlikely to go talk about it to some manager with the intent of getting someone fired, and that I mean well, and that not only do I talk about what not to do, but I show examples of what to do.  I keep my explanations free of jargon and use the simplest language possible that can still deliver the same quality point.\n\nThis has served me very well.  I am totally content.  I have no burdens on my conscience.  People don't mind my input (at least after they get convinced I love and not hate).\n\nMaybe not everyone can be like me.  I have some skill with my approach.  Maybe if someone else tried to do what I do, they'd get themselves kicked out of the job immediately.  Who knows?
