Typically a slug gun is a shotgun with a barrel appropriate for shooting slugs, and even a .410 slug would drop a bird that size without issue. For some reason I am thinking you didn't hit it. And you sure as hell wouldn't have heard the noise it made as it hit the bird because the muzzle blast would have masked it. Now there is a story lacking any kind of evidence.\n\nYou should have been hunting with something practical if you were going to do it at all. I hunt deer with a .308. They drop like rocks as long as your shot placement is decent. If I hunted with a .22 I'd poke holes, they'd run off, and they'd bleed out in extreme pain over hours if not days. Wisconsin white tails are seriously overpopulated. They run out into the road and  get hit on a regular basis around here, sometimes severely damaging the car or injuring the occupants. Their venison tastes fucking amazing as long as you get all the tallow off. Some of the most fun I've had with my girlfriend's family has been screwing around while feeding non-steak worthy cuts of meat through the meat grinder to make countless pounds of hamburger. If guns aren't your thing there is also bow season, which I plan to get into once I can afford a the hardware. Another plus to having a bow is that you can use it to hunt turkey during their respective season.\n\nIn my opinion eating meat you hunted yourself is much more humane and logical. I know people who are vegetarians solely because of the insane ratio of grain it takes to farm raise a single pound of meat. They say that if America cut its beef production by 30% we could use the left over grain to seriously dent if not end world hunger. Well, if you bag a few deer every year you can cut your beef consumption by half easily, you do the public a service, and you have the satisfaction of knowing you can feed yourself if food stops magically appearing at the supermarket. And what does it cost to kill a deer? The ammo I use costs about 60 cents a pop. And I shouldn't forget to mention that deer are a completely organic source of meat. I am not going to have an \u201cend of blood lust\u201d story because the benefits of hunting significantly outweigh the cons. It is unfortunate that all of your survival instincts have been breed out of you. Have you ever worked with cattle? People like yourself remind me of them.\n\nI think your experience with guns and gun owners is far too limited to me making such harsh judgments. People who are armed are not paranoid, they are typically more at peace knowing that if their safety and the safety of their loved ones lies in their own hands, be it warding off some kind of physical assault or a shortage of food, they will be able to survive.

You can protect yourself for a very small amount of money, or you can hope the police will protect you for nothing. The chances of you or a loved one being harmed by a criminal are very low, so you may get through life without any issues and the money spent would have been wasted. Or one night you wake up to breaking glass and a bunch of drunken hooligans rape your wife in front of you, then kill you both and take everything that isn't nailed down. The choice is simple for me.

Trying to scapegoat visaless workers as pedophiles is fascistic to the point of desperation. \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nThere are clearly social factors contributing to high crime in DC other than the availability of weapons. Trying to solve crime by putting more weapons into the system is insane.\r\n\r\nIf you look at global crime stats you will see a clear correlation between inequality and violence. Crime in the UK is pretty much the same as it ever was - the bulk of it is due to drunkeness... there has been an influx of gun use among teenagers, partly due to rising inequality but mostly a cultural thing (aka rap)... so the laws have been tightened. To say that banning one created the other is to badly misread the situation.\r\n\r\nI know this because I also come from England.\r\n\r\nYou need to get outside America to see how insane the American attitude to this is. Restricting guns is not like restricing drugs - every European country has a drug problem. The gun problems are fairly insignificant.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, NZ gun crime is worse then Europe - because we have fairly serious inequality here. But we don't get all paranoid about it and we realise that putting more weapons into the system won't improve things.\r\n\r\nI don't believe stupid does spread to be honest. Stupidiy usually comes about through insularity... and New Zealanders travel. A lot. \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nIt's not a matter of \"thinking of a situation when a gun might be handy\", it's a matter of realising that a population of people paranoidly arming themselves against imaginary enemies will lead to a lot of people being shot.\r\n\r\nAnd this is what happens.

Number of children sexually abused by illegal immigrants each year: 2,920 \n\nI have heard from many MSM reports that the number of children sexually assaulted is probably horrendously under reported. \n\nOkay, now that I'm done wowing you with the facts you could have googled in seconds, we move on to the equally amazing gun control law paradox.\n\nWashington DC has the most violent crime of any place in the US. (No, not just a joke about our current administration) That place is the motherfucking ghetto. Currently your chances of being shot and killed there are higher than your chances of being shot and killed in Iraq. And surprisingly, they have some of the strictest gun laws in the country. Only those grandfathered into the laws can own handguns. \n\nhttp://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3197/is_n3_v34/ai_7506367\n\nEngland has had significantly more crime since banning firearms. A good article on that here:\n\nhttp://www.reason.com/news/show/28582.html\n\nSo there you go. What you need to realize is that restricting  guns is like restricting drugs. All it does is create an illegal market for the corrupt Mafioso drug lord types to exploit and become rich off of. It fills our prisons with innocent stoners (or in this case patriots and sportsmen) who never hurt anyone while the prison industrial complex (who help bring the drugs in) gets richer and richer.\n\nI know NZ is half a world away, but stupid spreads, and one day you or one of your future generations will be faced with crap like this.
