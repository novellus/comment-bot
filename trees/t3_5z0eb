Only the most superficial differences - notably skin colour - separate the world's different population groupings. Underneath that skin, people are remarkably alike.'\n\nThis interests me.  I wonder if anyone here knows more about it.  I supose the 'superficial' here doesn't literally mean on the surface, or does it?  Are characteristics on the surface of the body genetically encoded differently than 'deep' characteristics, in such a way that they can change in fewer generations?  If 'superficial' doesn't mean that here, what does it mean?\n\nI would have thought that the genetic part of the rate of change of some characteristic in a population was to do with the heritability of that characteristic, and with the strength of the effect that that characteristic has on the ability to reproduce.  Does anyone know what the formula for this is?  Does anyone here know numerical values for the heritability of skin colour and of IQ?  Also, how big numerically are their effects on reproductive ability?\n\nIn order to make the statements about 100,000 years not being long enough for non-'superficial' properties to diverge, I guess someone must have worked out these figures, but I haven't been able to find out what they are, or what 'superficial' means in this instance.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5z0eb", "id": "c02b34b", "author_flair_css_class": null}
