But 12 separate steps seems like too many and yet the author bounces over certain things - such as the critical finding-the-direct-contact-person process....that need elaboration and should be a separate step.  Then, one step ends with, 'get right to the point', the very next step begins with, 'go into detail'. \nI'd like to see something like this that's more universally applicable, like how to write an effective but non-volatile complaint about a co-worker or to govt representative. These are much trickier to write well IMO than a complaint about a consumer transaction.", "author": "nice_halibut", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c02buw2", "parent_id": "t3_5zba1", "id": "c02buw2", "author_flair_css_class": null}
