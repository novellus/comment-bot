Lisp and others lack good standardized libraries (although I hear Lisp has improved *a lot*).\n\nWith Java the language is quite verbose, but Eclipse helps a lot with that, plus you get good debugging tools, great refactoring support, an extensive library, and so on.\n\nActually, I used ML before I went Java (because I happen to like static typing; it really auto-fixes most of my bugs, and it makes refactoring easy, as the compiler shows you all the places you still need to update when you change a data structure), but tool quality drove me to Eclipse.\n\nedit: I should add: it's not as bad as it sounds.  You can program FORTRAN in any language, but you can also write decent, modular code in any language that offers some building blocks.  Nested classes are much more verbose than functions, but they get the job done, plus sometimes you need a nested class with more than one function in it (so a closure wouldn't fit anyway).", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2fwo", "name": "t1_c02c53h", "ups": 1, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5ze57", "retrieved_on": 1427424993, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02c53h", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02c411", "body": "What do you use now?
