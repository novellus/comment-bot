There is little debate that the world is warming. The real debate is by how much, and whether it is worth doing anything about it.\n\nMy feeling is that the warming is less than advertised, entirely within the normal range and rate of natural changes in the Earth's climate, and that spending any money on it, except to alleviate its effects is one incredibly stupid thing to do.\n\nWe most pointedly are NOT a \"Type I\" civilisation on the Kardashev scale, and we won;t be for more than 100 years or more. When we become a Type I, then we can begin to modify the planet as we see fit.\n\nUntil then, we should not try to fuck with what we do not understand, and have no ability to predict what our efforts might do.
