Believe it or not, there are *rational reasons* for my beliefs and dismissing me as a prude and a repressor is ignorant.\n\nSex itself is not filth, but the perpetuation of pseudo-pornography in the media as well as the objectification of women that it encourages is not healthy for our society.  Mix that with how out-of-wedlock births [disproportionately affect minorities and the poor](http://www.leaonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327795jra0303_5?cookieSet=1&amp;journalCode=jra), how [lack of fathers affects delinquency and drug-use, etc](http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=2869037), and the [skyrocketing narcissism rates](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7618722) in younger generations, and we start to get a picture of a very strong correlation of so many of these problems with how sexually permissive society has become.  Girls especially are [risking psychological damage](http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=276922007) because of the sexually inundated society [more here](http://www.amazon.com/Unprotected-Psychiatrist-Political-Correctness-Profession/dp/B000S9ED38/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-4507865-7755215?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1192747638&amp;sr=8-1).\n\nI've read the argument that people 70 or 80 years ago were getting married at 12, but that is also an ignorant argument.  Culture has changed, and for the most part, become more enlightened.  We've learned and perpetuated that all races and classes and sexes are equal, and put that into practice in the West.  Why wouldn't views on sexual activity with younger individuals that are underdeveloped emotionally and intellectually advance as well?  If their brains are not developed and they are engaging in risky, potentially life-changing behavior, why are we allowing that to perpetuate with carnal \"hey they're doing it anyways\" attitudes.  You've been lied to for the last 40 years with the \"sexual revolution\" that merely was an excuse for an unrestricted pleasure cult revolting against \"The Man.\"  That freedom should be there, but it is up to the individual to be aware of the consequences, and they are not.\n\nYou ignorantly and demeaningly call my opinions \"prudish,\" but I am not advocating \"abstinence only.\"  I realize the information needs to be available.  But \"abstinence first\" is the responsible way to go.  With all of these negative trends in society, I am speaking out about the cultural rot that is destroying the West from within much like our foreign wars may be destroying us from without.  The parallels to Rome are striking, in that the complacency they felt as their culture became more and more self-centered and permissive, they felt less and less that their culture was worth perpetuating.  When the barbarians came, they rolled over.  Western demographic rates, like [Germany for example](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gm.html), show that population is declining as people become more and more narcissistic and the decline continues.\n\n&gt;Europe, Canada, AU/NZ have much more sexually liberated environments than the US, yet typically lower abortion rates and teen pregnancy.\n\nWhile admittedly the teen pregnancy rate is higher, Europe also has [more restrictions](http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1315152) on abortion than we do. (the site is a bit old, but laws haven't changed a whole lot).\n\nYou'll probably shrug off my worries as \"prudish,\" but that is your loss.  I can only assume you are anti-war, and you may very well be right that that was a horrible decision.  If I can acknowledge that, you can at least take heed of the situation present here and the warnings I bring up.  I may be over analyzing, but frankly there are too many correlations.\n\nShrugging our shoulders as 12 year olds have sex is not healthy for society, we are more advanced than that.  The goal should be encouraging them to make the best decisions, which is to wait, but giving them the resources should there be no other choice.  Things will be much better off then.\n\n*edited for clarity*\n\nAnd I am not sure why people vote this down, its against Reddiquette #2!

He found evidence of sexual activity in childhood, premarital sex, homosexuality, and extramarital sex.  He found that fewer than \u00bd of male orgasms were with their wives.  The majority of men's sexual experiences were \"socially disapproved\" and many illegal.  Masturbation was found to be nearly universal among men and quite prevalent in females as well.  It was clear that the older sexual ethic condemned much of what people did, and was a bit hypocritical.  Kinsey showed a great deal of sexual activity and very little of it concerned with reproduction.  The common motive was pleasure.*\n\nhttp://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/book/excerpt.asp?id=27  \n*Abortion was widely practiced during the entire period when it was illegal.
