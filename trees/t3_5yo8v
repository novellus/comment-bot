If I'm right, then at the exact center, everything is \"up\". But how big is that exact center? Where's the point of separation? At the very center, there must be a singularity where there is neither \"up\" nor \"down\". In other words, if you dropped a string through the hole to the other side, and tried to mark the string exactly in the middle point between up and down, the thickness of the mark you inked on this line would still need division. Somewhere in the middle of that ink mark is the exact center, but we could keep dividing this unti we reached the exact center, which would be neither up nor down; I.E., the aforementioned singularity. The weight caused by the Earth's gravity would crush anyone unfortunate enough to reach this spot in the nexus of earth's gravity field, I imagine. Anything falling through this hole would hit the singularity as if they hit deep water after falling miles. The body would hit the singularity and continue, now vertically upward, as a mist that would soon float back to the center, to be crushed to a floating, rotating, reddish pearl of super-heavy cells. That's the theory that I've developed over the years regarding this question. By the way, no one digging such a hole anywhere in North America wouldn't pop out in China, but in the Pacific Ocean.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5yo8v", "id": "c02a7yl", "author_flair_css_class": null}
