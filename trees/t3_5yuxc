Some of these licences are incompatible with the patent licence offered by Microsoft. It is up to the commercial open source distributors to ensure that their software products do not infringe upon Microsoft\u2019s patents. If they consider that one or more of Microsoft\u2019s patents would apply to their software product, they can either design around these patents, challenge their validity or take a patent licence from Microsoft.\n\n\nLooks like ballmers plan to sue open source users for patent violations is on track in the EU.  \n\nIf anything this might actually make it easier for MS sue in the EU because it tacitly recognizes those patents as applying in europe.\n\nAlso the guy was asked repeatedly about the fines and he refused to answer. Looks like MS will get another wrist slap.", "author": "malcontent", "created_utc": "1193131750", "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "programming", "ups": 0, "parent_id": "t3_5yuxc", "id": "c02ar72", "author_flair_css_class": null}
