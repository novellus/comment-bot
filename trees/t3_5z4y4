These have been around for awhile, but the solar cells on the surface is unique. A great idea as long as you can transfer the electrical energy created by the cells through a spinning base. That's a trick (and most likely the reason for a customer's first service call). The price is insane though, as it wouldn't be too difficult to make your own. All the parts can be found pretty much off-shelf. A bit of drilling and sawing would make everything fit. The helix doesn't need to be molded plastic though. Mylar sails could work almost as well if supported by struts welded to a central post. As always, a quality ball bearing race would be crucial. It would be a bit of work and cost, but nowhere close to their price of $42,000 over 25 years of expected life. That means you'd only get 7 years out of your investment after your 18 year payout.\r\n\r\nI'm very much in favor of alternatives, but letting eco-friendly industries present themselves in a boutique atmosphere helps no one but the producer. In other words, what's the use of such a device as this if only Robert Redford or Ed Begley Jr. can afford it? Bluenergy might have a winner here, but there's no way that it should take as long to pay off as your house. Come out with a $5,000 model and this company would have trouble keeping up with orders.
