The first test of his programming occurred in 1990, when Al Qaeda was successful in remotely directing Mr. Bush to trade Sammy Sosa to the Chicago White Sox.\n\nOf course, Al Qaeda itself is only a front for a little known group of Dubai businessmen, Al Yameen which, though it has taken an Arabic name actually consists entirely of Europeans.\n  ", "author_flair_css_class": null}
