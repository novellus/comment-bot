We are the world's 4th or 5th strongest nuclear power...nice to finally see it in print. That's why toady Bush is powerless to infleunce the policies of the Sharon government. The US continues to give us many billions a year! ... most of which has gone into building our nuclear weapons, fund our West Bank settlements, and pay for our spies and intelligence services! You don't like Israeli policy? Tough sh*t! You funded it all and we did the rest! 400 nuclear warheads...minimum. Remember that. Now, just imagine what our biological weapons scientists have cooked up and have sitting on the shelf, ready to go. Get this: NO ONE is EVER going to force Israel to do anything against its will. Try it, world, and find out what happens.\n\nA not so veiled threat from a fucking nutjob, lets hope the jackass that left that comment has *NO* influence on the Israeli government and does *NOT* reflect the views of Israel's government.", "subreddit": "politics", "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_5zhi7", "name": "t1_c02carc", "author_flair_css_class": null}
