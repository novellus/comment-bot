The rapid rise of privateering during the war was not caused solely by patriotic motives; for many armed ships fitted out in the United States obtained a thin Spanish disguise at Havana, and transported thousands of slaves to Brazil and the West Indies. **Sometimes all disguise was thrown aside, and the American flag appeared on the slave coast**, as in the cases of the \"Paz,\"[761]75 the \"Rebecca,\" the \"Rosa\"[762]76 (formerly the privateer 115\"Commodore Perry\"), the \"Dorset\" of Baltimore,[763]77 and the \"Saucy Jack.\"[764]78\"\n\n* 73 \n\"It is ascertained, by repeated instances, that the practice is for vessels to sail under the American flag. If the flag is rightly assumed, and the papers correct, no British cruizer can touch them. If no slaves are on board, even though the equipment, the fittings, the water-casks, and other circumstances prove that the ship is on a Slave Trade venture, no American cruizer can touch them.\"\n\n\nNews of [more captured American ships](http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9B04E3DF103FEE34BC4E52DFB066838A679FDE)", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "parent_id": "t1_c02b90j", "id": "c02bbza", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "name": "t1_c02b90j", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "ups": -2, "link_id": "t3_5z0ji", "retrieved_on": 1427425409, "id": "c02b90j", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02b8zd", "body": "FAIL:\n\n&gt;while slaves were still being brought over to New England under the American flag DURING the civil war.\n\n[citation still needed]", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "name": "t1_c02b8zd", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 1, "link_id": "t3_5z0ji", "retrieved_on": 1427425409, "body": "Section 9 of the [CSA's Constitution](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America) reads: \"The importation of negroes of the African race from any foreign country other than the slaveholding States or Territories of the United States of America, is hereby forbidden; and Congress is required to pass such laws as shall effectually prevent the same.\"\n\nhttp://www.courant.com/news/local/northeast/hc-complicity-excerpt-0925,0,1498485.story?page=2\n\nhttp://www.inthesetimes.com/article/2457/\n\nWhy should we throw away our flag when many more and much worse atrocities were committed under the American one? \n\n", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02b57r", "id": "c02b8zd", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c02b57r", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "ups": 2, "link_id": "t3_5z0ji", "retrieved_on": 1427425529, "id": "c02b57r", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02b4kk", "body": "[citation needed]", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_6", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 5, "author": "tootie", "created_utc": "1193272025", "children": [{"controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "created_utc": "1193322953", "ups": 0, "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5z0ji", "retrieved_on": 1427425408, "score": 0, "body": " I never said nor implied they were anti slavery, not many until 1862 were. \n\n\"My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery.
