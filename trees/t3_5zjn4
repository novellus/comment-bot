Tourism to America\n\nBoth of these are good things and will do nothing but BOOST American economic growth.  America will finally be on a track to net productivity versus net expenditure.  The lower rates will cushion any liquidity crisis the recent debt turmoil may stir up, and correlated (or weakening) Asian currencies like the yuan and yen will buoy American consumer buying power - just in time for Christmas.\n\nAnd speaking of China - guess what lower interest rates and low currency exchange values have done for them?  Double digit GDP growth.  Here in America we have gotten so accustomed to debt financing a strong currency that idiots like you think it's a BAD thing when our currency finalls falls in the midst of strong growth and low interest rates.

As the USD tanks, more countries (Kuwait, Syria, Saudi Arabia is slowly getting rid of their peg, Dubai will probably do this) are ditching the dollar.\r\n\r\n\r\nEventually countries will prefer non-dollar payments for oil. So the dollar is losing reserve status. A reserve currency allows the U.S. to run huge deficits with ease. To buy oil, you need dollars. To get dollars, you need a U.S. asset somewhere down the line(sell goods to the U.S., get a loan from the U.S. to allow people to exchange currency to dollars for use in buying oil). Simply put, the world's lust for oil actually helps the U.S. thanks to the USD reserve status. \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd in 2015, the boomers start retiring. At the time govt spending will dramatically increase our ability to spend will plummet. So we will inflate our currency to avoid our spending obligations(already happening, medicare+social security increase only with a low estimate of CPI). Of course Europe and Japan also have the same generational problems, but if the Euro is the world's reserve currency then Europe will do fine until people catch on to the euro fiat game.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is why I like gold or anything that has real, tangible value. The USD is coasting on momentum and as other have said, we're in a wile e. coyote moment except we're at the edge of the cliff right now. We will have a repeat of the 30s. Gold will be confiscated, (instead of terrorists, the evil doers will be 'gold horders' just like the 30s).
