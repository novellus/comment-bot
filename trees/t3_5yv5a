I am not close-minded, far from it. You cannot simply say that anyone who thinks The Secret is rubbish is close-minded. Self-help coaches use that all the time when people attack their arguments. By your logic I can claim that everytime you turn around people sprount tenticles which retract when you look. It is of course utter crap but you can't disprove it, and I can say your just 'close-minded' for not believeing me.  It is a ridiculous concept, that is why I oppose it.  Don't lump me in the same group as creationists. Evolution is pretty much a proven theory, the secret is not.\r\n\r\nI do attack the people who believe this for being lazy because they generally are.  All self-help programs try to give people the impression that they can change their lives with little effort and it's not actually their fault they are in the situation they find themselves in. It is. People are responsible for their own lives, the decisons they make, and the consequences they attract.  Most self-help programs are just a way for people to pass the blame for their lives to something else.\r\n\r\n  \"You twisted who is reading it without knowing for 1 hot moment who is really reading it\"\r\n\r\nI'm guessing your referring to the secret when you say this. In which case, I do know who mostly read it. It was made famous by Opera. Who is Opera's largest demographic? Middle America.  It's not like the secret is a hit amoung the scientific community and I just don't know about it.  Middle America is for the better part weak-minded. That is why they resort to self-help in the first place.\r\n\r\nLike I said before, exploring the science of the mind is not a bad thing. It is one of the next frontiers of science and should be encouraged. But, heeding the word of tapes that jump to conclusions such as the secret is not helping at all. It just sets back research into these concepts when they are attached to stuff like that.  Also, the attack on you and your mental appearence for endorsing the secret was a retort for you condecending me in your first reply.  Like I said, don't sigh at me like I'm an idiot when you are defending something which has no scientific or rational grounds.
