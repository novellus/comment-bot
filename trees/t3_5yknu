In times of feast or famine, your body can rapidly adapt epigenetically (this would be chemistry /after/ the DNA -- RNA aspects) to conserve or expend energy as needed. As such, it's entirely possible for groups of people to have made adaptations in a relatively few generations. It has only been the last 4 or 5 generations where food is easy to come by in the United States. As such, many people from all over the world may not have adapted /back/ to their feast mode, since ancestors could have adapted to a famine mode in the past (which would enable them to conserve as much energy as possible).", "author": "cowbellthunder", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c029vre", "subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "name": "t1_c029vre", "parent_id": "t3_5yknu", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}
