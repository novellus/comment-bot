Oh no, the \"T\" word.  Please explain to me, why are we still funding a War, which most Americans disagree with, but we can't fund health insurance for children?

If you are so afraid of taxes, don't take public transportation, don't drive on highways, don't drink water, take out your own trash, don't ever call the police, put out your own fires, don't go to public schools, and on, and on... I don't know about you, but I'd gladly pay more taxes in order for our youth to be insured.
