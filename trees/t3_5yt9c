Let me see if I can fill in the skeleton of the process for you, and help you to understand that 'a couple hundred barrels of diesel' isn't even close to the real cost of deriving, and using uranium.\r\n\r\nThis will not be a complete list, but I hope you get the idea. We will assume that the neccessary infrastructure for oil extraction, export, and use is already in place.\r\n\r\n1. Mine raw minerals and ores out of the ground.\r\n2. transport ores to refinery\r\n3. refine ores into usable state\r\n4. transport refined ores to manufacturing plant\r\n5. manufacture parts of large uranium mining equipment\r\n6. transport smaller parts to assembly facility\r\n7. assemble small parts into Uranium Mining Widget(tm)\r\n8. transport Uranium Mining Widget(tm) to uranium mining area\r\n9. **insert '100's of gallons of diesel'**\r\n10. transport raw uranium ore to processing plant\r\n11. process ore into usable state (be sure to have built this processing plant also, see steps 1-7 but for this facility instead of a processing widget)\r\n12. transport usable ore to facility where it will be used (please be sure to have built this facility first also, see steps 1-7 again)\r\n13. Creat infrastructure to distribute electricity produced by your uranium electricity generator facility (good old steps 1-7 again, but this time for infrastructure)\r\n14. Use uranium to produce electricity\r\n15. Profit.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, how exactly do you think you power each of those steps in my admittedly incomplete list? How much energy is invested in any given step, and the steps that support that particular step, and how is that cost of that energy represented in the finaly cost of the product produced? What is your return on the energy you invested in each step (EROEI)? What happens to the cost of each step as the inherent energy involved in it grows more and more expensive, and more and more scarce?\r\n\r\nThe point is this: Nothing is done in isolation. Oil, and petroleum products are absolutely required for each and every step of the process. As they get more expensive, so does everything that relies on them. It also becomes more difficult as energy becomes more scarce.\r\n\r\nExtracting uranium to a 'usable state' ABSOLUTELY requires massive inputs in the form of fossil fuels.

Its going to cycle up and down as 'demand is destoryed', and then once oil is 'cheap' again, it begins to be used again. Eventually enough 'demand destruction' will occur as to render the uptick impossible, and then its anyones guess.\r\n\r\nI put demand destruction in quotes because its just a pretty way of saying that lots of people are going to die.\r\n\r\nThe only true way to reduce demand is to have less people around.\r\n\r\nI find that idea horrible.\r\n\r\nI know you will find people who are gung-ho for 'a change', or 'getting back to family life and the land', if fact, I'm having a discussion further down in the thread with just such an individual. \r\n\r\nUnfortuantely, for those 'solutions' to pan out, you have to have far, far less people on this planet. Which again gets back to the whole lots-of-people-are-going-to-die thing.\r\n\r\nAgain, some people seem to be ok with this idea. Thats mostly because they assume that the 'most people' subset doesn't include them.\r\n\r\nBut when you start to look at the numbers, and try to get back down to population levels that were pre-industrial, you're looking at 2 out of every 3 people on the planet not being here anymore. Those are not good odds. And thats only if we go down in a quiet, and ordered fashion, and just kind of level off at 2 or so billion.\r\n\r\nI highly doubt people are just going to throw off their mortal coils peacefully. I highly suspect that there will be much raving, and gnashing of teeth, and probably a nuclear war to boot. So we'll probably drop down well below the 2 billion mark, which also means that your odds just got even worse.\r\n\r\nNow, to address your two points.\r\n\r\n&gt;A. The dollar has seriously inflated, making current prices not quite as bad as they seem.\r\n\r\nCan't argue with this one. The dollars value has been seriously degraded lately (and on purpose I might add, its easier to finance our huge national liabilities if the dollars we're using to pay them off are worth less). It is a contributing factor to the price of oil lately. However, if you run the inflation numbers, you see that the gains in the price of oil far outstrip the decline in the dollar. Oil was at something like ~$15/barrel in the late 90's or early 2000. It just slapped 90 last week. Thats what, a 6 fold increase in 7 years? The dollar has tanked, but not that much by any stretch. I certainly agree that a portion of the price increase is due to the lesser value of the dollar however.\r\n\r\nIts still a really bad sign, thats probably about to get a lot worse.\r\n\r\n&gt;therefore we aren't at peak oil as far as oil geologists know.\r\n\r\nI highly doubt that those people on the ground could honestly say that they don't see, and understand the fundamental nature of the problem.\r\n\r\nEarth = finite.\r\nPopulation = growing exponentially.\r\nDemand = growing exponentitally.\r\n\r\nGiven enough time, demand *will* outstrip supply.\r\n\r\nToss in declining outputs as historically proven on every well in the US, the north sea, and just about every place that isnt the middle east, and you have an even bigger issue, with demand outstripping supply even faster.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, as we discussed above, the only real way to get rid of demand is to have less people...\r\n\r\nI believe that those in the know probably have figured that they should get while the getting is good. Try to suck the last bit of profit out of it, and retire to their gated, guarded compounds as it all comes crashing down, everyone else be damned.\r\n\r\nI'll be honest with you. If it was me and my family, or your and yours, I'm pretty sure you are smart enough to figure out who's side I'm on. If I have some insider info that gives me a perceived advantage over you, I *will* leverage it against you for the preservation of my own life, and the lives of my families.\r\n\r\nIf that means you die so that I might live, I'm sorry, but I am prepared to do that.\r\n\r\nAnd in general, I'm a friggin peace loving, liberal yuppie pushover. Ask your local hells angels contingent how they'd feel about running roughshod over your 'human rights' to get what they need to survive.\r\n\r\nNow, I agree that it'd be pretty damn statistically impossible for every single insider to 'keep it quiet'. Well, they arent. You can find many many articles on theoildrum.com, peakoil.com and other such sites from industry insiders detailing their understanding of the problems.\r\n\r\nHell, there's even a chevron commercial where they are very nakedly asking for ideas from the general public on how to 'solve' the problem. \r\n\r\nThat is not confidence inspiring.

The petroleum industry folk who would be strongly investing in these solutions (tar sands, etc) evidently don't believe the price of oil will stay at this level long enough to make a profit with alternatives.

And of course, if your economy is failing, where's all the money for developing, installing and scaling up the infrastructure for those 'alternative solutions' coming from? \r\n\r\nIts not just the price-at-the-pump that everyone immediately thinks about.

And if she 'cheated' on any of them, her experiment is kind of invalid under our assumptions for this discussion.\r\n\r\nI've heard numbers that float around the 1 acre of land per person to be reasonably sure that with crop losses to insects, theft, and natural disaster (hail, flooding, etc) you can be reasonable assured of growing enough food for one person in an organic way. That still falls under your 5.6 acres of land per person, minus non-arable land (but just barely, and only for right now, check [this link](http://one-simple-idea.com/Environment1.htm)\r\n\r\n&gt;In 1959, there were 12.16 acres per person, &gt;world-wide (i.e. 36.48 billion acres / 3 &gt;billion people). \r\n&gt;In 2006, there were 5.46 acres per person, &gt;world-wide (i.e. 36.48 billion acres / 6.68 &gt;billion people). \r\n&gt;By 2039, there may be only 2.81 acres per &gt;person, world-wide (i.e. 36.48 billion &gt;acres / 13 billion people). \r\n\r\n&gt;The U.S. has 3.794 million square miles, of &gt;which 3.54 million square miles is land &gt;area (for 300 million people as of the end &gt;of year 2006).\r\n&gt;That is only 8.09 acres per person in the &gt;U.S.\r\n&gt;However, only about a quarter of that is &gt;arable land.\r\n&gt;That means there are only about 2.02 acres &gt;per person of arable land in the U.S.\r\n\r\n&gt;However, consider that there is only 12 &gt;million square miles (7.68 billion acres)\r\n&gt;of arable land on the planet.\r\n&gt;And, ignore for a moment that arable land &gt;is being lost at a rate of 38,610 square &gt;miles per year. \r\n&gt;That is, lets assume no arable land is &gt;being lost for the next 33 years.  Then&gt; . . . \r\n\r\n&gt;In 2006, there was 1.15 acres of arable &gt;land per person, world-wide (i.e. 7.68 &gt;billion acres / 6.68 billion people). \r\n&gt;By 2039, there may be only 0.59 acres of &gt;arable land per person, world-wide (i.e. &gt;7.68 billion acres / 13 billion people).\r\n\r\nCutting it awfully close already....not counting losses, or increased population.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, again, the problem is one of scale. Do you really expect every single person to put down their gun, and pick up a plow? Do you really expect everyone to compost, and build greenhouses, and cycl eback to an agrarian society in an orderly and quiet fashion? Wouldn't it be so much easier for me to just watch you toil away all year, then kill you and take what I want? Why didn't this system arise in previous civilizations? And if it did, even approximately, lets say in medi-evil england, do you really think the feudal system was a happy way for the serfs, who made up 99% of the population to live?\r\n\r\nI'm telling you, if I, a generally peaceful, reasonable, and rational person, can think up a plan in 30 seconds to kill you and take your stuff, that means so can any other person on the planet. Toss in a fanatical leader with promises of a better tomorrow, and you've got yourself a nice little roving army of pillagers.\r\n\r\nThe only way that the back-to-the-land bit works is if the population density goes way, way down. Which is just a round about way of saying again that 2 out of every 3 people need to die before you reach a point at which that is sustainable again without the inputs from abundant and cheap energy sources.
