What Al Gore is saying is that if I don't want to pay for my health care ... I have a god given right to pull out my gun, find some body (preferably a productive somebody who has started his own company and thus is more capable of paying), point my gun to his face, and then if he refuses to pay my bill - or fights back.  Pop a bullet in his head and spatter his brains all over the wall.  \n\nOf course, Al Gore, being the \"generous\" person that he is - will spare me all the difficulty of going thru the collection process myself.  Instead, if the guy refuses to pay, he'll send trained government thugs to collect for me.  That way if he fights back and they spatter his guts all over the place, they can say that it was his fault for defending himself and relieve me of the pain and guilt and hide me from seeing the piece of shit consequences of my own choices being brought to their logical conclusion.\n\nThanks, Al.
