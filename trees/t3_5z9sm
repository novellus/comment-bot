It was black and shadowy, and moved really weird. I tried to scream, nothing came out, I tried to get up and run, but I couldn't move. I got a limp arm raised about 10 inches off my side, and my attempted screams came out as loud hisses.\n\nFor a long time I thought it was real, wasn't till years later I found out what a waking dream was, might be what these people claim to have seen.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
