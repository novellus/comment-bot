Also, some name combinations are used always together (like Jos\u00e9 Luis) and it's very uncommon to drop one. And, lastly, some name combinations have as a default to drop the first name and use the second (for males, anything starting with Juan, like Juan Ignacio; for females, Ana, like Ana In\u00e9s, or Mar\u00eda).

You are exactly backwards. The founding fathers created a republic structured so as to give the appearance of being democratic, but which was calculated to thwart and diminish the power of the vote, and in particular, that republican structure was designed to prevent \"innovation\" (according to Madison) and designed to prevent the masses from \"uniting\" and finding their \"common interest\" (again, quoting Madison). Madison et al., calculated that this structure would protect the \"minority of the opulent against the majority\". The structure disempowers the vote, rendering the state into the hands of Big Money, hence plutocracy.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, the governments these days are PARLIAMENTARIAN, which is *exactly* what the founding fathers disliked, when they saw how they were working in the several colonial states. These parliamentarian govts that were starting to take over in the several states under the articles of confederation were, in the words of Founding Father Elbridge Gerry, an \"excess of democracy.\" Madison and the other founding fathers agreed. They saw how these parliamentarian state govts allowed the working people to control their own governments and tax the rich and help out working people with bankruptcy protection. \r\n\r\nSo the Fathers then seized the opportunity presented by the REAL revolution  that was starting to take place both in america and in western europe (which was populist in nature and against the mercantilists and the aristocrats), and the Fathers then tactically created egalitarian propaganda in the form of the Declaration of Independence (to rope in the masses with a false dream). \r\n\r\nThen, using the Declaration and the constitutional preamble (another false front of egalitarianism camoflauging elite-friendly republican structure), they instituted surrepitiously the anti-democratic, republican government via their rich man's constitution that dominates us now. \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd that is why I do not vote, and why I do not expect our politicians to do what we want them to, unless the particular issue is one that is harmless to Big Money or that helps Big Money. \r\n\r\n\r\nWar helps Big Money.

INSTEAD, AMERICA IS A REPUBLIC. What is the difference? As the FOunding Fathers wrote in the federalist papers and said at the constitutional convention, a republic would keep the majority from being able to control their nation by voting to any substantial degree. THe structure of the american republic means that the rich (the \"minority of the opulent\" as James Madison put it) would be able to keep their wealth by electing the people they wanted who do the things that the rich wanted, instead of doing things the rest of us want. THe structure of the govt as defined in the constitution is what makes America a Republic and not a democracy.\r\n\r\nSo what does all this mean? It means our politicians do not really have to do as we want once they are elected. One would think that Americans would catch on to this concept, seeing as how it happens time and again....but NOOOOO....they keep thinking that America is a Democracy. Well, it aint.\r\n\r\nSo you got no right complaining about whatever Bush does. If the rich people want Bush to start a war, he will. And you can't do nothing about it. America is NOT a democracy. James Madison, the father of the constitution, wrote RIGHT IN THE FEDERALIST PAPERS, that democracy is not the kind of government that he wanted for America. \r\n\r\nIf you want to live in a democracy, western europe is FULL of them. There ya go!\r\n\r\nHeck, Canada is pretty darn democratic. But America is NOT. We are a republic. And in a republic, MONEY decides. You do not.\r\n\r\nIf you want to live in a nation that is not a warmonger, try a democracy like France, Germany SWeden, Holland, Belgium  etc. These are all parliamentarian systems--democracies. Not like America. America is a Republic.\r\n\r\nThey are not constantly at war because they live in democracies. We are because we do not live in a democracy.\r\n\r\nThey have universal healthcare, cuz that is what the people want. We want it too, but we cannot have it. America is not a democracy.\r\nget hip to what is going on.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll cleared up for you???\r\n\r\nGood!\r\n", "author_flair_css_class": null}
