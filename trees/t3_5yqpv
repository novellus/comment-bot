Capitalism would either have the government run them or a actually regulated entity.  Unfortunately, in general, we have politicians (and most people) that don't understand capitalism - they believe regulations are undue government interference.  Regulating the market for the wrong reasons (like protecting sugar industry) is a bad idea.\n\nBut the theory of capitalism is based on regulating the right things.  And I doubt that will happen well with the natural monopoly that are roads.\n\nBut since letting someone else build the roads seems like the easy way out I bet we are going to get a chance to see over the next few decades.  Once you realize you have sold a public good (either the road itself or the right to use the road for a reasonable price) then we will learn that those paying knew the toll demand is very inelastic meaning they could raise prices very high and not reduce demand much.  So they will do so and make a huge sum of money.\n\nMost likely the government would instead of trying to optimize the revenue from the road to optimize the economic benefit from the road.  Doing so likely means taking a loss on the road (it is pretty obvious economics that good infrastructure encourages economic growth).  Though some special situations might make profiting on heavy use roads to support transportation spending (on new roads, mass transit, etc.).\n\nIt is simple to support all infrastructure spending needs for transportation with a gas tax.  The fools that thought a 50 cent or $1 a gallon tax would cripple the economy obviously lost all credibility in the last 2 years.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5yqpv", "id": "c02ab0l", "author_flair_css_class": null}
