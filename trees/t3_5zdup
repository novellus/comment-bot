It was saying that most people with normal functioning frontal lobes (and area that also governs acceptable social responses; think about &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage\"&gt; Phineus Gage &lt;/a&gt; ) have trouble with the problem.  This is because when you think of a typical equation, you use one equal sign.  People who don't gravitate towards standard social responses (people who think out-of-the-box, or people with brain damage) have an easier time breaking the response mold and using two equal signs.  Basically, I would say that people who think out-of-the-box have an easier time overriding the typical frontal lobe suggested response.   This does not equate to brain damage.  \r\n\r\nAnyway, you did bring up a good point.  Huckabee has to have something wrong up in the attic.\r\n\r\nAlso, as we can see now, having brain damaged leaders does not bode well for the country.  So I don't advocate it.
