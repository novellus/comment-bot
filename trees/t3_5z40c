Soon we'll be back to where we were 10 years ago!\nWebsite: http://evnut.com\nOur main vehicle is a Toyota Rav4EV (charged from the solar panels on the garage roof). These fully electric, 80 mph, 100+ mile range vehicles were built from 1997 until model year 2003. Ours is a 2002, and we have 50,000 miles on ours after more than four years of driving. Many drivers have gone over 100,000 miles and are still going strong on the original batteries. So here is a ten-year-old battery technology that offers over 100 miles of battery range. And today we're struggling for seven or ten or even 40 miles? I guess if we work hard enough, we can eventually find out way back to where we were ten years ago. :sigh: GM had the EV1 going about 150 miles per charge.... and today the promised Volt will manage 40 miles... if we can just find the batteries that will allow that huge range!", "author_flair_css_class": null}
