Hell, I'll happily use Wine. I hardly thing using a KDE application on GNOME is far \"off the beaten track\". The average end-user scenario isn't \"is this a KDE or GNOME app?\", it's \"What's the best application for the job?\"\n\n&gt;This is a matter of habit. I personally greatly prefer Alt-F1, as it doesn't pop up the menu on an accidental keydown, and it frees up the Super key (That's the \"Windows\" key)\n\nI'm not saying the \"Windows key\" needs to open the menu, but something logical where you don't have to stretch my hand over half the keyboard would be helpful. And it's not just familiarity either - I've found myself using the mouse more since installing Ubuntu, since Alt+F1 isn't a comfortable shortcut for me to press.\n\n&gt;Why do you need to? The menus are organized 100% better than the Windows start menu.\n\nBecause I organise my \"Applications\" menu how I see fit, that doesn't necessarily correlate with what the application developer thinks. Not knowing which folder the icon ends up in once it's installed is an annoyance of mine too. \n\nPersonally, my Windows menus are much better organised, since I sort them by hand into personal categories. In Windows I have something a start menu folder called \"Web Development\", which contains shortcuts for loading Apache, loading up a certain FireFox profile, Notepad2 (my editor of choice), Dreamweaver and all sorts. This seems to be extremely difficult, if not near impossible in Ubuntu, which is extremely frustrating.\n\n&gt;Do you really need to? As a user, you should generally never ever mess around outside /home/username, and indeed you don't have to, as there is no rational reason whatsoever to install a random application in /foo/bar.\n\nThere's plenty of typical examples where I've needed to know this - I agree that I wouldn't need to know this in the ideal world, but we're living in a world where I need to hand-modify my X11 configuration to get Ubuntu to fit to my native resolution. \n\nWhatsmore, where is the thing in Ubuntu that says \"Stick to your home directory\"? If I hadn't have known that from prior Linux knowledge, I probably would have shoved files everywhere.\n\n&gt;The \"Big icons\" you complain about are provably better for usability. See [Fitts' Law].\n\nGreat, except the same \"big icons\" I complain about get in the way of people who are familiar with the application.

Simple things are in general easy, but doing anything that's even slightly complex is needlessly complicated compared to Windows. Silly things like using internet KDE apps in GNOME results in funny windows appearing about flushing the HTTP cache. Basic things like keyboard shortcuts are stupidly unintuitive (Alt+F1 to load the applications menu, anybody?).\n\nSorting GNOME's \"Applications\" menu with \"Edit Menus\" is clunky, horrible and doing anything with it takes far too long, and the menu system itself and, if you wish to edit by hand, it is almost hilariously complex compared to Windows XP's simple shortcut system. I'm not sure how the different UIs managed to agree on using a menuing system that's so stupidly overengineered and unintuitive for the average user.\n\nDocumentation is fairly poor. The forum support is, in general, extremely helpful, but resorting to Google every time isn't great, and there doesn't seem to be a nice introduction to the Linux filesystem layout and where Ubuntu actually puts things away from the gloss from within Ubuntu itself, and even very little acknowledgement of the command line. As simple as having a searchable help and reference with all the man pages and an introduction to the layout of the POSIX filesystem would be a huge boost, particularly when too often the UI falls short on what I'm trying to do (particularly in GNOME).\n\nLike all Linux distros, it's also curiously ugly and in general suffers from big syndrome, where it seems that everyone likes needlessly oversized and ugly icons and fonts. I assume there's some sort of geek attraction to it. Application names are often so stupidly named is beggars belief - yes, there's the much publicised The Gimp, but Kile (LaTeX editor), Amarok (MP3 player), Krita (Image editor), Kexi (Access-style database app) and K3b (CD burner) and all tragic victims of the horribly stupid KDE \"K\" naming scheme which makes life needlessly hard with unfortunate cryptic names where most begin with K so they're far too easy to mix up. There's also far too many applications which are avaliable from repositories which seem identical and functionally do the same thing, but it's difficult to find out what the preferred one is, and too much choice is a bad thing - I make the analogy of uTorrent being pretty much the defacto torrent client on PC, yet on Linux there's KTorrent, Transmission, Azureus, Rtorrent and several others that all command significant market share (in the end I used Wine to emulate uTorrent).\n\nMany applications are curiously unstable - for some reason, FireFox like to crash and hang randomly. Ubuntu in general seems slow when compared to my old XP installation that it replaced - no doubt it's faster than Vista, but that's hardly much of a claim to fame, frankly.\n\nI still think something akin to Autopackage needs to become widespread, so it isn't a pain in the backside for proprietary software vendors and users who wish to install something that isn't de facto free software, or would prefer to ship stuff on CD. Double-clicking an EXE and getting a self-extracting installer is preferable to using dpkg. \n\nI'm sure there's many others, but there the things I can think of. Despite the criticism, Ubuntu is getting there, slowly but surely, and it's just about a reasonable replacement, particularly as hardware support is continually improving, but it still doesn't touch Windows IMO.\n\nEdit: Accidentally repeated myself, deleted it.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
