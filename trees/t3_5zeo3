If you had read what I wrote, I said outright, \"I support the cause of informing people about Atheism.\" The issue I take is when you start mobilizing into a huge group and functioning as a unit - Atheism is not a tool for uniting people to do shit, it's a tool for freeing people from intellectual and scientific slavery. Atheists have no common agenda and no common association with one another, it would be like grouping everyone together who doesn't like mayonnaise as the same \"type\" of person with the same opinion on everything.\n\nSo instead of the RRS' typically reactionary and emotional response to any sort of critique, why don't you actually read a message and say something important for once? I bought a bumper sticker and a shirt from the RDF the day they went on sale because I support Dawkins' efforts to scientifically inform people, but I refuse to support the formation of an Atheist organization which has a single agenda. I want no part in it and I can tell you outright that it's not going to end well.\n\nYou want to know something? I fucking hate when Jesus Freaks come up to me and tell me that the only way to save myself is to accept Jesus Christ as my lord and savior. I hate it more than anything when I get preached to. When Atheists are out there preaching about how badass Atheism is and how it's the only way to live one's life, I know it bothers people as much as Jesus bothers me. The goal of Atheism is not to make an effort to convert people, it's only there to show that there is a rational, scientific alternative to religious superstition. Atheists have no duty in proselytizing because, like I said, there is absolutely nothing that unites us beyond a rejection of a single idea. \n\nSo, look, the world would be a whole lot better off if religious dogma were to vanish suddenly and be replaced by logical and rational inquiry into the world around us, but I cannot and will never support a group which goes around telling people what to do as if their voice speaks for all Atheists. It doesn't. It won't. It never will. \n\nP.S. - real classy with the downvoting too, I'm glad I get to see the level of your maturity.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 1, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5zeo3", "retrieved_on": 1427425012, "id": "c02c3na", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02c3na", "parent_id": "t1_c02c3k4", "body": "Supporting the cause of informing people about atheism includes supporting atheists outing themselves so society can see how many there are and to see who they are.
