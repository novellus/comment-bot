It puts things in a bit clearer perspective overall, while doesn't discredit the objective of the article, which does only report Apple's worth in relation to the stock market.\n\nOf course there are many other factors involved in the value of their assets. Clearly, I think IBM has a great deal of capitol and assets to devoted to a much larger infrastructure of development, distribution and support than Apple does. But also, with that, I'm sure they have a great deal of product that doesn't move fast. That is very common with any large company. Apple has always striven to keep their inventory overhead low. Something smaller companies have to pay attention to, and do so, with an under the gun mentality. But, I'm sure, IBM isn't lazy in this area either, but they do have to make sure they have a large enough inventory, in case they get a huge run on something, to fill very large orders. If that demand goes away, those assets, while calculated and perceived as something worthy, would then become a liability. Apple would not suffer those same consequence, as they often, run very close to the bone, often frustrating consumers when products are not available.\n\nIn the end though, Apple is doing quite well, and there seems no end in sight. Some have speculated that being late with Leopard will hurt them. I think, and this is just my opinion, after the fiasco of having to go as far as implementing an XP rollback program, consumers are wary of rushed out OS upgrades. It is clear, that Apple waited until Leopard was done. I don't see Leopard as a very flashy upgrade, but it is significant under the hood, and it's a simple upgrade. I don't think consumers want to hear too much about how the next operating from anyone is the next best thing since sliced bread, and Apple, going low key on Leopard, will fit that nicely, because it's not revolutionary, and they aren't really putting it out like it is, aside from the usual marketing hype any company will come up with. I doubt there will be an OS rollback program for Leopard, as we've run into with Vista. Leopard is impressive though, in how much easier it is to use and navigate things as compared to before. I certainly wish I had many of those features in XP. ", "author_flair_css_class": null}
