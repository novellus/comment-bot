If the system were designed from the get-go with this capability in mind then it's resolvable. They are already talking about a rather large infrastructure investment (solar, batteries) for the home, the car can only reasonably be recharged from there, then perhaps a simple system for making a switch is possible, even desirable. \r\n\r\nMy way of thinking of it solves a lot of problems. Think of filling stations. If you have standardized battery packs that can drop out of the bottom or rear of the vehicle, then you can pull onto a platform at a station, the platform removes your pack, installs a new pack and off you go. The old pack goes into the filling station's charging area to be recycled. You end up paying for the charge and a depreciation fee.
