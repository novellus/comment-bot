I try to do what I can to leave it off.\n\nParticularly applies to you.\n\nNow let me explain this to you even more methodically than I already have.  The book you speak of, the only book written on the subject, is called [\"The Wave\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Strasser).  It was written by a man Todd Strasser under the pen name Morton Rhue, as can clearly be seen from the wiki page.  Strasser/Rhue had absolutely NO part in this experiment.  It was a *fictionalized* interpretation of the actual experiment.  It should also be noted that this book was turned into the made for TV movie I mentioned, and from what I can tell, fairly accurately, so in a way I've seen much of the same source material as you have.  \n\n[Now here's something else that I've read](http://www.vaniercollege.qc.ca/Auxiliary/Psychology/Frank/Thirdwave.html).\n\nThat's a primary source, straight from the horses mouth, and a non-fictional account, which was one of the things I was basing my argument on.  \n\nDo-un-to was right when he said group identification played a critical role in each experiment, but it plays a role in **any** social psychology experiment.  The difference here is both the information garnered, and the way the experiment was conducted.  In the summer camp experiment, the groups were created in order to ensure equality and to prompt competition, but in the Wave, only one group was created, thus the methods were very different.  In the summer camp experiment, the overall objective was to dissect the groups into individual characteristics; see who emerged as a leader, how quickly they did, how support was for the leader was displayed, and see how the two groups interacted with each other.  In The Wave, the purpose was simply to have students conform to a dictator, to *obey* them.\n\nSo yes, groups were present in each study.  But conformity was what was being studied in one, while individuals were being studied in the other, making these two experiments entirely different animals.  Something a bit more comparable to The Wave would have been Zimbardo's SPE, or Milgram's Obedience Studies.  The SPE especially since it was about group conformity but more centrally obedience.  \n\nNow you can continue(and you no doubt will) to use ad hominem attacks against me, but I've explained myself, and I've documented the reason why I believe I'm correct.  You have only accused me of being an arrogant asshole and remarked that you \"don't have time to write an essay for\" me.  I'm not asking for an essay, just your reasoning for why these two relate to each other in a somewhat detailed and complete fashion.  I can honestly say that the only anti-intellectual here is the one who won't discuss this issue and the one who's so far refused to provide any explanation for why he thinks what he does.  In that sense you were right though. Anti-intellectuals *are* scary.
