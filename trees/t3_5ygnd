It's generally accepted by most mainstream economists as a classic example of [market failure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure).\n\nA public good is generally defined by two characteristics:  *Nonrivalrousness* and *Nonexcludability*.  The former means that the use of the good by one person does not prevent its use by someone else - if that were the case, we'd still need an allocation mechanism.  The nonexcludability idea is that you can't realistically deny people access to the good.\n\nThe natural environment is a good example on both counts.  The fact that I enjoy clean air doesn't mean that someone else *can't* enjoy that same air.  Also, you can't sell people access to clean air, because it's all around - nonexcludable.\n\nSince you can't charge the beneficiaries of clean air for the cost of maintaining it (because of the nonexcludability), and the benefits go to everyone, mainstream economics theory justifies government action to ensure provision of the public good.\n\nHealth care is a trickier case.  On the one hand, it's can be called both rivalrous and excludable - a hospital bed being used by one person cannot be used simultaneously by another, and you can feasibly prevent people from getting into the hospital.  When a good has these characteristics, we generally ask the government not to intervene in the market.\n\nBut - and this is how the argument generally goes in Canada, where I live - health care might very well be called nonexcludable because we cannot *morally* deny it to people, even if we *physically* can.\n\nSo what do we do with something that is rivalrous but nonexcludable?  That's what we call a \"common good\" in economics.  But common goods are, in most examples, things like water or wild game - provided naturally.  So the theoretically preferable response to common goods - auction off property rights - doesn't work here, because there's no incentive toward supply.\n\nSo we wind up with government paying for hospitals, and supplying single-payer insurance in Canada.\n\nAs for the USA, you guys (on the left at least) are fighting for health care to be bought into as nonexcludable.  Once that's bought into by enough of the electorate, **mainstream economics is on your side**.  It is your friend, not your enemy.\n\nI'd advise everyone here to spend a little time listening to economists.  They're social scientists and can, from time to time, produce some really interesting ideas, even when they're counterintuitive.  Don't beat up on an entire scholarly field just because a few of its practitioners - on both the left and right - have some policy prescriptions you disagree with.

Again, no one is perfectly free to compete - we all have different resources to compete with. Two (theoretically) equal golfers with identical equipment may be 'free to compete' on an equal footing, but if one is a foot taller than the other, someone is getting the shaft.\n\nI hope there are some golfers here.\n\nI build a golf course, and sell memberships and charge greens fees to those willing and able to pay. We both benefit. I pay property and other taxes, which pay for local schools and national needs. I employ caddies and guys who cut the fairways... all with cascading social benefits. \n\nHowever, I submit that it is impossible to calculate and pay (fairly - whatever that means) for every benefit I receive. I cut down trees, reducing the ability of the ground to prevent runoff, adding a bit to the possible flooding down-elevation, I fertilize the grass, increasing the nitrogen load in waterways...\n\nHowever, the question was about 'efficiency' which means that seller and buyer agree about the price of something to a good approximation of what perfect knowledge says it should be, so everyone is happy and the economy rolls along. \n\nThis text box is too small.\n\nContinued in next comment.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
