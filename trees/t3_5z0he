What is \"socially acceptable\" varies from community to community, venue to venue.\n\nOr to put it another way, do we want to see arresting millions of people for bullshit reasons to continue being socially acceptable?  We've put millions of people behind bars with _real_ criminals, should that continue to be socially acceptable?  What about all the death this policy deliberately causes upon people?  You can't promote things like alcohol and tobacco that you know kill people in great numbers while striving to make less lethal drugs illegal just to make them less socially acceptable.  If anything shouldn't be socially acceptable it is the callous disregard for life such a policy represents.\n\nThe government has no role here.  The proof that this is so is simple.  How would you react if the government mandated drug use for children?  Is that a proper role for government?  Should it be the government who decides whether your children use drugs, or you?\n\nWho would you rather see selling drugs?  Law-abiding citizens in a legalized, regulated environment who _won't_ sell to kids?  Or criminals in today's prohibitionist environment who _will_?\n\n", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 4, "author": "twistedcain", "created_utc": "1193248751", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 1, "author": "shiner_man", "created_utc": "1193249263", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 3, "author": "ElectricSol", "created_utc": "1193251689", "children": [{"subreddit": "politics", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 1, "author": "shiner_man", "created_utc": "1193261025", "children": [{"controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "politics", "archived": true, "name": "t1_c02b4gb", "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5z0he", "retrieved_on": 1427425539, "score": 3, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02b4gb", "author": "ElectricSol", "created_utc": "1193261485", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "ups": 3, "parent_id": "t1_c02b4ea", "body": "Believe me guy, if you really wanted some crack, you'd get some crack.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 1, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5z0he", "retrieved_on": 1427425540, "id": "c02b4ea", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02b4ea", "parent_id": "t1_c02b34z", "body": "&gt;Damn good logic.

My main point was that by increasing the cost of risks associated with trafficking thanks to enforcement (raids, seizures, jail or death) the price of the drug increases as well. AND, since cocaine is inelastic, in that although prices rise as a result of US source control policy, demand doesn't necessarily fall.  People addicted to cocaine will still pay the markup for cocaine.  So, since prices rise, and demand doesn't change, the profit potential to sell cocaine soars.  Source control actually encourages the drug trade because there is a great potential to make mega millions. \n\nWe spend $1billion/yr fighting colombian cocaine.
