This started about 24-36 hours ago now.   \n\nI find it somewhat annoying, as I like to read the reddit links in their own window and read comments at the same time.  \n\nI know I could just purposely go out of my way a little and open links in their own window... but then, why have the preference in the preference section.   \n\nI have tried this one four machines with various OS's -- windows, linux and Max OSX.  It appears to happen in multiple browsers too -- happening in Firefox, Ms IE and Safari. \n\nThanks in advance. \n\nUpdate: I now know that this isn't just me.
