One party rule sucks. Gotta love that nepotism and union cronyism!\n\nMassachusetts isn't representative of the country as a whole, and I tend to vote Democrat in federal elections. I would also stop short of voting Republican if the state started to tip, since I wouldn't want them to have a majority. I'd just like a few moderate Republicans in there to keep 'em honest.\n", "author": "api", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c029ncg", "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": "t3_5yguz", "name": "t1_c029ncg", "author_flair_css_class": null}
