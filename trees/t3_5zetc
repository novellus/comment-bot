That there has existed for some decades a primarily Russian-held a-biotic hypothesis for the formation of crude oil is solid fact. (Please note that I only stated that this theory exists, and placed no value on its validity or lack thereof). \n\nIt's also true that American oil production \"Peaked\" back in the 70's. However, this author fails to recognize the impact of such things as [steam-injection technology](http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3159/is_2_220/ai_54063591) which had a revolutionary impact on oil production domestically -- just as deep well drilling seems set to do so once again with the [Jack deposits](http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_4292203). (And, of course, all of this is easily documentable with Google searches.)\n\nHowever, it is painfully worth noting that the  biotic origin of fossil oil is effectively irrelevant, as is documented by the efforts to  bring to marketable strength the [algal biofuel products](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algaculture). Algal biodiesel is far more friendly to the food/fuel comparison because algal aquaculture can be conducted on non-arable land... and can produce 10's of thousands of barrels of fuel per acre compared to ethanol's hundreds. \n\nCombine that with [LS9](http://www.ls9.com/)'s work to convert biologically derived lipidinous substances into traditional petroleum or specific refined products of oil... and there's really no need to be concerned about this whole thing.\n\nAnd that's even ***without*** radical developments such as operable boron-hydrogen inertial-electric fusion (which, as compared to a tokamak fusion generator doesn't require rare fuel materials and doesn't produce radioactive byproducts), or chlorophyll-based self-assembling photovoltaic polymers, or ultra-efficient silicon pv cells, in conjunction with non-volatile high-load transferable lithium-ion batteries (or just [commercially viable fuel-cells](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell) )... I could go on, obviously, at length...\n\nBut the end result to all of this is that the name of the game is  no longer \"oil\" so much as it is \"energy\". And ***that***, more than anything else, is the reason why you don't need to worry about \"Peak Oil\". Because, once again, the tired libertarian axiomatic canard is proving itself true, much to everyone except libertarians' surprise and chagrin: left to its own devices, the market provides it own solutions to its own problems.", "author": "IConrad", "created_utc": "1193727571", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "science", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_c02c41s", "id": "c02c45w", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "ups": -1, "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5zetc", "retrieved_on": 1427425007, "id": "c02c41s", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02c41s", "parent_id": "t3_5zetc", "body": "[citations needed]\n\n", "author_flair_css_class": null}
