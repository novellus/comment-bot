By raising a kid you implicitly take a hand in determining the direction of the entire human race.\n\nAs I said, bikes and cars only put a very few people at risk at any one time, but raising another Pol Pot, or Cheney, or Kim-Jong Il has exactly the same effect, and more, to thousands or millions of people.\n\nI understand that killing people who are already alive is bad (obviously), and that pretty much everyone (present US administration aside) subscribes to the idea of inalienable human rights - I also do.\n\nWhat I'm not so clear on is why having children is one of these inalienable human rights - you can live a perfectly fulfilled life without siring offspring (no-one's saying don't have sex, or offer to help with other people's kids).\n\nWe already routinely screen child-care workers, teachers, babysitters and the like to determine if they're \"suitable\" to work with kids... but we don't screen the one or two people who spend the vast majority of their time with the child, and from whom the child derives the majority of their young experience and opinions - whether educational or traumatising.\n\nWe also ban paedophiles (for example) from any contact with children... and yet someone who picks up their baby in a fit of pique and uses it to club their partner in the head, fracturing the kids skull and putting its very *life* at risk... is free to go on banging out sprogs as long as she wants.\n\nYou've probably guessed by now that I'm playing devil's advocate, but I'm still curious to see if anyone can give me a good answer.\n\nI take your point about the risk of letting in eugenics by the back-door... but why does the determining factor have to be anything controversial?\n\nBefore you're allowed to have a kid you have to take a few parenting classes, you have to demonstrate you have the material resources to care for this kid *in addition to* any you already have, and you perhaps have to undergo a short counselling course to make sure you want to have a kid for the right reasons (ie, because you want to raise one, not because you're trying to save a marriage, or need someone to bully, or want a bigger welfare cheque).\n\nFail the tests (or pass them and then mistreat your kid) and you lose the right to any more, either for a defined period and/or until you reapply and pass the test again.\n\nNone of these things should reasonably prevent someone from having at least one or two kids - even families on welfare can afford to raise a couple of kids.\n\nWhat it will do is stop people having kids for the wrong reasons, having more kids than they can reasonably support, and it'll emphasize that having kids should be an honour and an obligation to treat the kid right, not a god-given right you can abuse at will, or a route to a larger state handout.\n\nAs I said, I don't fully believe this - it's a hypothetical thought experiment... but what's wrong with it?", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c0299tc", "id": "c029a5o", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_6", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 5, "author": "imgoingtogetdowned", "created_utc": "1192459985", "children": [{"controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1427426395, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "archived": true, "name": "t1_c029afp", "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5ybds", "downs": 0, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c029afp", "author": "HiggsBoson", "created_utc": "1192461582", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t1_c029a7i", "body": "Ladies, I'm your man.", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_6", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 8, "author": "edheil", "created_utc": "1192461731", "children": [{"controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "archived": true, "ups": 2, "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5ybds", "retrieved_on": 1427426391, "score": 2, "body": "Even if you don't want to use IQ tests, it's pretty easy.

I'm also not talking about rendering the offender sterile of anything permanent - simply ban them from having children, with immediate adoption of the child and *incredibly* harsh punishment for anyone who violates the ban.\n\nPeople can use birth control if they want, or they can simply refrain from penetrative sex.
