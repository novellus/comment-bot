There are LOTS of procedures designed to eliminate screw ups, but service members are human beings.  They get tired.  They fall into a routine.  They screw up.

Without that code the bomb will not detonate.  This is controlled by electronics in the bomb which refuse to work without the code.

The security in this case is supposed to be procedure, paperwork, and double checks.  Bombs are moved all the time for maintenance, rotation, etc.  Lots of people screwed up in this case.\n\nWhen I was in the service in Alaska in the early 90's a similar incident on a tiny (non-nuclear) scale occurred.  A pair of F-15s was supposed to ferry air-to-air missiles from Elmendorf AFB to the forward base at King Salmon.    When ferrying missiles they are supposed to be mounted on the plane in a manner where they are inert.  Instead they were mounted as active weapons by accident.\n\nDuring the flight the two F-15s dog fought as they normally do for training.  The problem was that when the pilot \"simulated\" firing a missile, a real missile fired.  He radioed ahead the \"oh fuck\" message and other other pilot was able to get away with only a mangled plane he could return to base with.  \n\n(As an aside, I was able to see the plane in a hanger after the investigation, it was amazing the thing still flew)\n\nAt least a dozen people screwed up.  The weapons loaders, the crew chiefs, the pilots of each plane, etc.  All of those people were SUPPOSED to double check the missiles were loaded inert.  Instead they ALL pencil whipped their job.  Plenty of people were disciplined including the squadron and wing commanders who lost their jobs over this.  This was a career ender.\n\nStealing a quote from John Schilling...\n\n\"Not making fuck-ups on the ground, is not an option.  Humans fuck up, \nperiod.  Human institutions fuck up.
