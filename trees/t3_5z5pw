The best architecture can do, besides being functional (which should always be point 1) is to be a piece of art, however subtle: to touch us some way, to subtly encourage us to feel or think something, to express an emotion, thought, or something else.  Using natural features as an inspiration but still creating an \"artifical\" environment is perfectly resonable, IMHO.  Indee, they claim to be trying to reach into some deeper human connection to the \"nautral\" environment, and though I'm not sure of the premise, I don't mind the attempt.\n\nYes, it is silly to design a tree house and call it ecofriendly.  But, and I may be missing this group's aim, to take inspiration from natural spaces to make better human spaces isn't something to scoff at.
