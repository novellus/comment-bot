(run by hindu-nationalist BJP party).\n\nThe videos found on the following links just proved this wrong. The State Gov., the police  and the VHP (World Hindu Council) planned this in great details and executed one of the most gruesome genocides in recent history..\n \nThe \"sting\" Operation was carried out by \"Tehelka.com\" who infiltrated top BJP (ultra right-wing Hindu nationalist) party. \n\nThey caught several top Hindu Leaders boasting on Hidden Camera how they organized and executed a state wide pogram to \"irradiate muslims\" from the Indian state of Gujarat..\n\nVideo and transcripts (more details) can be found at Tehelka.com (respectable news agency) below:-\n\nhttp://www.tehelka.com/story_main35.asp ", "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": "t3_5z8o6", "ups": 1, "author_flair_css_class": null}
