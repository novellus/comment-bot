The moderates in this country are being pushed around by extremists from both sides.  I agree with you that it's not right, but it's as old as politics itself.  It's up to the moderates to decide, like they do every election.\r\n\r\nI don't agree that the name-calling, etc. are a sign that so-and-so hates America.  If they didn't care about the country, they wouldn't get involved in public discourse and would be as apathetic as the 2/3's of Americans who don't even bother to vote.\r\n\r\nFrom the perspective of the left, neocons are anti-American because they are restricting freedom, lowering the credibility and respect of the nation on the world stage, and abandoning all of the lessons we learned about geo-political struggles post-WWII.\r\n\r\nFrom the perspective of the right, liberals are anti-American because they don't have (blind) faith in their leaders in what they see is a worldwide struggle of epic proportions.\r\n\r\nBut to not be able to separate leader from country is a grave mistake that will hurt the right in ways even more than the 2006 mid-term elections.  It's almost like a dehumanization of the populace is in place.\r\n\r\nBy that same token, the left could be damaged by not following the will of the people who voted them in to (in part) end the war in Iraq.  Nor have they been very effective in ending the stalemate of the right's unified front.  In other words, it's not what they're doing, it's what they're *not* doing.\r\n\r\nA caveat would be to not place the opinion of Reddit users (or any particular segment of a population) onto America at large.  That said, it is nearly universal that Reddit users are reflecting the position that Bush is unpopular, but that says more about Bush than it does about America or even Republicans, of which there are several here.  But I doubt that more than a few Americans here could honestly say they \"hate\" their country and want it tossed into the dustbin of history.\r\n\r\nIf the lack of positive stories about America is a problem, feel free to submit some.
