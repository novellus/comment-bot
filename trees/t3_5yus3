The major problem here is if some factor they never though to consider that factor when forming the pairs in the original study influences both (so-called \"confounding variables\"). \n\nIf the study establishes a causal link, it still won't tell you which caused the other.  For that, you can make inferences about plausible causal pathways, or do follow-up studies (e.g. reduce BMI and see if IQ increases).\n   ", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "name": "t1_c02amrc", "parent_id": "t1_c02aljd", "id": "c02amrc", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "ups": 3, "name": "t1_c02aljd", "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5yus3", "retrieved_on": 1427425784, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02aljd", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "parent_id": "t1_c02al2b", "body": "Thanks for the reminder.
