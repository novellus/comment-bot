This author makes no attempt to understand or empathize with the \"Christian Right,\" instead dismissing them as \"fundies,\" and using that most mature tactic of spelling words with dollar signs in place of \"S\" characters.\n\nFrom there, exceeding complex convoluted logic is rolled out to illustrate why people might not be thrilled to vote for someone who disagrees with them on so many fundamental issues.\n\nI know we all love a good conspiracy theory, and this author certainly delivers, but maybe the reasons the right doesn't like Giuliani are the obvious ones:\n\n1. He believes abortion should be legal.\n\n2. He has publicly stated that the government should pay for abortions for those who can't afford them.\n\n3. He has publicly supported gay marriages.\n\n4. He has publicly supported gun control, which is an issue dear to several end times-focused Christian organization.\n\n5. He married his cousin and then had the marriage annulled.\n\n6. He once told a wife he was leaving her via a press conference.\n\n7. He's been known to dress as a woman every now and then.\n\nIs it that hard to believe that people who disagree with you might still have principles?  Libertarians and the Christian right have been traditional Republican strongholds, and Giuliani manages to utterly alienate both of them.  Might that be the reason he's finding so much opposition?\n\nThis author offers precisely zero pieces of evidence to back up his \"un$poken reaSon,\" just the assumption that those with whom he disagrees are necessarily acting on bad faith.
