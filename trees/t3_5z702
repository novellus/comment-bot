Getting back to your original statement (the one I quoted), it implies that there is some kind of life cycle beyond waterfall or iterative.  There isn't.  Waterfall has no feedback (ie. there are no cycles in the graph which describes the ordering of processes).  Iterative has feedback (there are cycles).

In waterfall, you don't plan a single pass.  If you are using a waterfall lifecycle, there IS ONLY ONE PASS.
