A decade ago, China's capability to produce anything even as relatively uncomplex as simple optics was a pitiful joke. Made in China was a death stamp for optics, medical equipment and tractors. Currently, nearly all the big players in the sport, medical and research optics fields have partnerships with plants in China, often making equipment that's only a B or B- notch below the top-end European and Japanese products, but at a fraction of the cost. And these days, finding new tractors or generators that aren't made in part or in whole in China is getting tougher.\r\n\r\nBut, what China is really good at right now is making increasingly better copies of existing products or ideas. At least at present, they seem to be lagging in innovation. Now, that's not really surprising, given how far and how fast they've come. Going from oxcarts to rockets and consumerism in a generation is one heck of steep learning curve. So, perhaps the innovation that the Chinese are historically legendary will once again rise to the surface. (Though having a couple generations of innovators and intellectuals silenced or killed can't be helping in that regard.)\r\n\r\nThe real question is how long the resources and cheap energy hold out as contrasted to the Earth's ability to deal with pollution. At what point does consumerism itself implode due to finite resources, finite pollution tolerances, finite demand, and bad economic models on all sides of the equation?", "author": "Independent", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c029dvl", "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c029dvl", "parent_id": "t1_c029din", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 2, "name": "t1_c029din", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5yctf", "retrieved_on": 1427426355, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c029din", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c029cyk", "body": "Good points.
