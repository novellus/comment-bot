First, you have given zero evidence that the eyeball evolved but once.  (Even if it did evolve several times, it is an extraordinarily interesting fact that each time it evolved in such a way that all species have exactly 2 eyes.  Do you really believe that during the evolution of, say, the first vertebrates, there were a whole plethora of species, some with 3 legs, some with 5, 6, 7, 8... and only those that \"succeeded\" survived?  Dennett and Pinker call these kind of stories greedy-adaptationism.)\n\nSecond, your \"argument\" sounds like the religious argument.  And human intelligence exists as an undeniable fact, if not through God, but because...?\n\n[ddi]: http://www.churchofvirus.org/books/ddi.html\n", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "science", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 1, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5yjt8", "retrieved_on": 1427426071, "id": "c029zfm", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "name": "t1_c029zfm", "parent_id": "t1_c029z4l", "body": "   &gt; Since you are not an evolutionary biologist or sufficiently claim you'll forgive me for completely throwing your own personal claims out of the window.\n\nRight. And you should throw my personal claims on the likely validity of global warming out the window too, despite the fact that I draw the claims from the consensus opinion of the scientific climate community.\n\n&gt;In science what matters is the content of what is said, not who says it.\n\nSorry, I'll stick to what appears to be the consensus of the biological community. The one thing I know about biology is that biological community knows more about biology than I do. If I'm ignorant of a field, I have to appeal to an argument to authority, and trust the consensus of the experts. \n\nI think that this sort of revisionist thinking by non-scientists is what gave us things like creationism, or global warming denial. It is nice to be able to weigh all of the arguments oneself, but it is impractical. It ignores the fact that the people in the field are experts, and have devoted their whole lives to understanding the subtleties of their discipline. I can't even contribute intelligently to subfields within a spitting distance of mine, much less endorse a philosopher who wants radically to revise all of biology.\n\n&gt; You have either willfully or mistakenly failed to respond to the fact that there exist several cultures which do not use numbers but have the cognitive ability to use numbers nevertheless.\n\nI was supposed to respond to this?

We just have it, for reasons unknown.\n\nRight. So humans 'latently' have a certain set of broad abstract reasoning skills that can be turned to math, among other things. So what? Who claimed that counting specifically was an evolved skill?  How about hula-hoop dancing? These primitives could just as easily be taught to hula-hoop, without hula-hoop being a part of their culture.  Would this show latent hula-hoopism, or just inherent physical dexterity that can be turned to many ends? How about Ancient Greek? They could be taught Ancient Greek, but it would not illustrate a latent Ancient Greek capacity as much as a latent broad linguistic capacity. I would argue that in your counting case, humans have an innate capacity for *logic*, that some cultures have turned into a capacity for math.\n\n&gt; Dawkins's stories and computer simulations about how several traits could have evolved by the means of natural selection and selfish genes are just that: stories.
