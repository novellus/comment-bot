It points out that women are asking for raises less often because they are punished for trying to negotiate in a way that men are not. \n\nThe discussion you give about a glut of talented female engineers is specious. There is feedback between how you perceive you will be treated in a certain career, and which career you go into. So there's no glut of talented female software developers, but that doesn't mean that there isn't a problem. \n\nIn any case, I don't want to argue about whether or not there is genetically based gender differences for the simple reason that we haven't really got a clue. So even if it's *really* plausible to you, since we don't know, we really ought to investigate other options before being forced to this one (and of course, the same goes for racially based profiling of this type). So the hue-and-cry about it is a general feeling of 'what can we do to fix this?'. It's people publicly struggling to come to grips with these issues. \n\nFor what it's worth: it's worth noting that in area after area, once women move in/become accepted, that area becomes devalued. So for example, being a secretary used to be a respected male position. Psychology used to be a largely male dominated profession. Teaching was done by men, to men. None of this proves that you are mistaken here (insofar as you are actually making a claim), but it's worth noting that these things shift over time. \n\nFinal side note: In Linguistics, semantics is the most technical field in terms of mathematical sophistication; However, semantics as a subfield in linguistics is dominated by women (and I believe becoming more so, but I'm not in that loop so much anymore). So somehow they're managing to dominate this extremely mathematical area. \n\nend of counter-rant.

First I can definitely say that there is much more gender hostility in the CS world than there is in the library science world.  It\u2019s not as simple as blatant sexism, but I have definitely seen many women made to feel uncomfortable in classroom and work environments.  Not that this discomfort can\u2019t be over come, but it just makes the environment that much less appealing.  Additionally you aren\u2019t going to devote your life to a profession where you are always going to have to have your gender be an issue.  As a male librarian of course this comes up now and then, but not nearly as frequently as I\u2019ve seen it come up with women in CS environments.  \n\nSo why is there so much more discussion about the lack of women in CS than men in Libraries? 2 big things come to mind.  1st Computer Scientists typically make a lot more money then librarians.  No male is going to complain that not enough men are making lower salaries in another profession.  That\u2019s the nature of inequality.  All of the female dominated professions you mentioned make less money then their male dominated counter part.  2nd even with 90% of the profession being female, at least 50% of the management in libraries is male, so it\u2019s still a male dominated world.\n\nOne other thing I always hear brought up in these conversation is \u201cWell women don\u2019t like to make crude jokes, and can\u2019t just let their hair down and be one of the \u2018guys\u2019 blah blah blah.\u201d  Having worked in environments of 90% women, yes, yes they can.  Women know how to bust balls just as well as any guy does, and I\u2019ve heard just as many crude things come from women as men.\n\nOne final thing I want to add to this rant is that real sexism (and racism for that matter) IS NOT CONSCIOUS.  People often claim that they aren\u2019t sexist because they don\u2019t openly state \u2018women are inferior to men\u2019.  But real sexism is a culture logic that is embedded deep within the way you look at the world and think about things.  Sexism is something that\u2019s the default in your thinking, and something that you have to actively work against (same with racism).  The reason sexism and racism are so difficult to remove is that those in the position of advantage don\u2019t consciously see that this is the case.

Is it so unacceptable that, shit, maybe women just aren't as interested in it on average?\n\nI don't see why we would assume that, statistically, there would be no gender dimorphism in 'interests' when there are so many demonstrable dimorphisms in other areas.  The one that comes to mind is this [psychological study](http://www.autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2001_Connellan_etal.pdf)  (which happens to start out saying: *Sexual dimorphism in sociability has been documented in humans.*)  that showed that newborn female babies prefer to look at pictures of faces, while male babies prefer to look at pictures of mechanical objects.  Is it unreasonable to believe that on a statistical level females may be more interested in social, interactive roles while males may be more interested in seclusive, machine-related roles?  Our brains aren't even the same: women use both halves to speak -- men only one.  Notice all the diseases that affect one sex drastically more than the other (autism, 10:1 m:f).\n\nIs it some coincidence that in all such areas that are stereotypically \"male\" (mechanics, plumbing, electrical work, construction work, aviation -- anything dealing with science or engineering) we see a huge gender gap?  Why do you think there would be rampant sexism in *just these areas* but **not professions that are stereotypically gender-neutral**?\n\nIs it a coincidence that the stereotypically *female* professions (interior decorating, nursing, fashion, design, elementary school teaching, nannies, *any profession that involves children*) have the reverse 'problem'?  Why are so many gay people dis proportionally interested in fashion?  [2]\n\nDon't you think that if there were this huge glut of talented female engineers, overlooked because of sexism, that some company would have hired them by now at a reduced rate, gaining a huge advantage?  I mean, male:female software developers is like 10:1 or more.  If you're saying that females are held down because of sexism, then you should assume there is a **giant cheap (undervalued) labor source**.  I have no answers to the questions I have asked just now, but I have faith in the human ambition to become rich.  If there actually were a shit-ton of talented male interior decorators, or female engineers, all held down by sexism, then someone who does not have this bias would have hired them for cheap and made millions.  The market adjusts itself.  Occam's Razor, and all that.\n\nYou may also be interested in this article on a study that demonstrates [men make more money than women because they ask for raises significantly more](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/29/AR2007072900827.html).\n\nI would be most surprised if despite all these readily observable differences, our two genders were *exactly* the same in subjective areas like this [1].
