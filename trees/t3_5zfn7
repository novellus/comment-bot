[emphasis added]\n\n&gt;As the IAEA Board of Governors has underlined, suspension \"is a voluntary, non-legal binding confidence building measure\".

It seems like you are the one unwilling to let the IAEA do its job.\n\n&gt;Don't you get it? The IAEA enforces the NPT, not the other way around. \n\nWell, yes, that's my point. The NPT itself is the law, not the ruling. Hey, let's take a look at what the [NPT](http://www.fas.org/nuke/control/npt/text/npt2.htm) says. Here's a quick summary:\n\n**Article I:** nuclear weapons states may not transfer nuclear weapons or capability to any recipient whatsoever.\n\n**Article II:** Non nuclear weapons states may not receive nuclear weapons or capability from any recipient whatsoever.\n\n**Article III:** Non nuclear weapons states must follow the safeguards agreement in accordance with the IAEA; and the safeguards agreement must be implemented in a manner designed to comply with Article IV.\n\n**Article IV:** All parties have an inalienable right to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination and in conformity with Articles I and II.\n\n**Article V:** All parties should ensure that benefits from any peaceful applications of nuclear explosions should be made avaialable to non nuclear weapons members.\n\n**Article VI:** All parties underake to negotiate in good faith toward the goal of disarmament.\n\n**Article VII:** Any group of states is allowed to negotiate to assure regional disarmament.\n\n**Article VIII:** Members have the right to propose amendments, subject to majority vote plus all nuclear weapons states and IAEA board members.\n\n**Article IX:** The Treaty is open to all states for signature.\n\n**Article X:** Any member has the right to withdraw from the Treaty. The members will convene after 25 years to discuss renewing the treaty.\n\n**Article XI:** Authorized translations of the treaty shall be deposited in the archives of the Depository Governments.\n\nFor our purposes, the most important articles are I through IV. There is no evidence Iran is in violation of either I or II, and Iran has always remained in compliance with III. That leaves IV, which establishes Iran's \"inalienable right\" to develop nuclear power in a manner consistent with I and II.\n\nIn other words, the IAEA ruling was *wrong*. Iran is not violating the NPT, and Iran is demonstrating willingness to cooperate with the IAEA as long as its rights under the NPT are not denied.\n\nWhy do you have such a hard time understanding this?", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02cdxn", "parent_id": "t1_c02cdov", "id": "c02cdxn", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c02cdov", "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "ups": -1, "link_id": "t3_5zfn7", "retrieved_on": 1427424882, "id": "c02cdov", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02cdlg", "body": "&gt;there is no evidence of Iran doing anything that violates the NPT.\r\n\r\nThis claim is the crux of your argument.

The IAEA identifies that Iran is not disclosing some of its activities and demands that Iran do so.\n\n2. Iran voluntarily adopts an Additional Protocol, suspending uranium enrichment activities and making the entire country open to IAEA inspectors. In return, it asks to be treated fairly.\n\n3. For over two years, the IAEA crawls over Iran, finding nothing to indicate that Iran is hiding nuclear weapons activites. During this time, the IAEA resolves most of its concerns regarding Iran's activities. Nevertheless, the US publicly engages in a war of words, issuing a constant stream of accusations about Iran, and the EU-3 follows suit.\n\n4. Iran sends the IAEA a number of proposals to the IAEA/EU-3 aimed at exchanging carte blanche access for an end to the hostility and a promise of the right to resume enriching uranium when it is complete. The proposals are *ignored*.\n\n5. After more than two years of carte blanche access but before the IAEA can complete its inspections, Iran runs out of patience and gives the IAEA notice that it will drop the Additional Protocol and resume its enrichment activities, since the US/EU-3 categorically denies Iran's right to enrich uranium even if it passes its IAEA inspection. Iran still adheres to its normal obligations under the NPT.\n\n6. The US strong-arms the IAEA into declaring Iran in non-compliance with an order to continue suspending enrichment and referring Iran to the Security Council.\n\n7. The Security Council issues a resolution ordering Iran to suspend uranium enrichment, which Iran ignores, given its right under the NPT to develop nuclear power and in the context of a diplomatic environment in which it does not feel that it will be treated fairly.\n\n8. The Security Council issues two more Resolutions reiterating its order to stop enriching uranium, and imposes mild sanctions.\n\n9. The IAEA continues to work with Iran diplomatically, and manages to secure an agreement with Iran to establish a work plan to resolve the remaining issues - exactly what Iran had previously been offering and was ignored.\n\n10. The US ignores this agreement between Iran and the IAEA. It tries but fails to secure an additional Resolution from the Security Council, and imposes its own unilateral sanctions against any person or company that does business in Iran.\n\n11. During this entire time, the US constantly denies that Iran has the right to develop nuclear power, accuses Iran of secretly developing nuclear weapons (but can produce no evidence to support this claim), and threatens to launch military strikes to destroy Iran's nuclear development infrastructure and possibly its government. \n\nI really don't see why anyone has a hard time understanding why Iran has behaved the way it did. The way *diplomacy* works is that you punish bad behaviour and reward good behaviour. The stick is the threat of imposing sanctions for failure to cooperate; the carrot is the promise of fair treatment for cooperation.\n\nThe US approach to Iran from the beginning has been to punish bad behaviour and good behaviour equally. If Iran refuses to cooperate with the IAEA, the US refuses to allow Iran to develop nuclear power and will threaten a military attack. If Iran agrees to cooperate with the IEA, the US *still* refuses to allow Iran to develop nuclear power and *still* threatens a military attack.\n\nCan you see how this approach is designed to produce an escalating, unresolvable conflict? \n\nThe US did exactly the same thing with Iraq, insisting that no amount of evidence of Iraq's compliance with UNSCR 687 would be adequate to lift the sanctions and demanding that regime change was the only acceptable course of action, even though this clearly violated international law.\n\nIf Iraq refused to cooperate with the IAEA and UNMOVIC inspectors, the US said it was obviously hiding something. But if Iraq agreed to cooperate with the inspectors (which it did), the US said it didn't matter because, as Donald Rumsfeld argued, no inspection team could ever be intrusive enough to eliminate a secret WMD program and, as Colin Powell added, \"the United States believes the Iraqi people would still be better off with a new kind of leadership that ... is not of the despotic nature that the Saddam Hussein regime is.\"\n\nIn other words, the US set a threshold of cooperation that Iraq could not possibly hope to meet.\n\nThe US is doing exactly the same thing with Iran today, systematically eliminating any possibility of a diplomatic solution as it approaches the point of no return for a military action against Iran.\n", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "ups": 0, "name": "t1_c02c8re", "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5zfn7", "retrieved_on": 1427424946, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02c8re", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02c7ui", "body": "You seem confused.\r\n\r\nYou link a document from 2005 listing proposals from Iran giving the IAEA carte blanche to their program.\r\n\r\nThen you post a link with IAEA Chief in 2007 saying that for the \"first time that Iran had agreed on a work plan to address all outstanding issues.\"\r\n\r\n2005 != 2007 ?", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "ups": 1, "name": "t1_c02c7ui", "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5zfn7", "retrieved_on": 1427424958, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02c7ui", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02c7o5", "body": "You need to stop begging the question.

The IAEA spent over a year crawling all across Iran during its adoption of the Additional Protocol, and has maintained access to Iran through the NPT requirements. \n\nThe IAEA has some outstanding issues it wants to investigate - issues, let's recall, that Iran was offering to resolve two years ago - and has just agreed with Iran on a work plan to address them.\n\nIn other words, when they IAEA says it has no evidence Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons, it is speaking from evidence, not ignorance. \n\nBy contrast, when the US claims Iran *is* trying to develop nuclear weapons but can produce no evidence whatsoever to support this claim, it is spewing pure propaganda.\n\n&gt;Don't you get it? The stakes for iran are war. \n\nThe stakes are war because the US has decided for foreign policy reasons that it needs to stop Iran from becoming a regional power not beholden to US interests, building ties to China and Russia, undermining the petrodollar hegemony that allows the US to run $800 billion current accounts deficits with impunity, controlling the third largest conventional oil reserves on earth, and so on.\n\nThe \"nuclear weapon\" excuse is just that: a sideshow to distract people from the real foreign policy objectives - just like the non-existent WMD and al-Qaeda ties that distracted people from the real reasons to invade Iraq and replace its government with a friendly client.\n\n&gt;When faced with this, why would they not abide by the UN? \n\nBecause abiding by the Security Council would mean Iran abandoning its perfectly legal nuclear power program, losing a battle of wills with the US, and accepting American suzerainty over the entire Middle East.\n\nAlso, and this is very important, **Iran is in a win-win situation**. The US can launch disabling missile strikes but does not have the military capacity to overthrow the government or occupy even a significant fraction of the country.\n\nIn return, Iran can effectively blockade the Straits of Hormuz, cutting of a big chunk of global oil disribution and driving oil prices up to hundreds of dollars a barrel.\n\nIf the US attacks, Iran gets to play the victim and the world sees confirmation that the Great Satan is a hypocritical, imperialistic rogue state, while still preserving its political leadership (in fact, enhancing it in the normal manner of rallying against an external foe). \n\nIt also brings its allies Russia and China to bear. Russia has already indicated that it would regard an attack on Iran to be an attack on itself; and China absolutely needs to maintain its long-term oil contracts with Iran (that's why it's ignoring the unilateral US sanctions).\n\nIf the US doesn't attack, Iran gets to develop its economy the way it wants and gets the regionally important bragging rights of playing chicken with a superpower and winning.\n\nEither way, Iran's status in the region improves and the US looks bad. \n\nThe US thinks it's painting Iran into a corner, but it's really doing that to itself. It has no way to back out of the faux crisis it manufactured without losing face.\n\n&gt;why is it Brazil manages to be developin peaceful nuclear power with the IAEA, \n\nAfter decades of pacification, Brazil does not represent a threat to US foreign policy.\n\n&gt;but IRAN doesn't want their inspectors around?\n\nThat's a lie.

When that didn't happen, Iran reverted back to the normal provisions of the NPT, to which it continues to adhere.\n\nThe \"other steps\" are a straightforward violation of the NPT, which grants signatories the right to establish a civil nuclear energy program.\n\nIn other words, this Resolution simply reaffirms demands that were already unreasonable to begin with.\n\nFrom UNSCR 1747:\n\n&gt;Determined to give effect to its decisions by adopting appropriate measures to persuade Iran to comply with resolution 1696 (2006) and resolution 1737 (2006) and with the requirements of the IAEA, and also to constrain Iran\u2019s development of sensitive technologies in support of its nuclear and missile programmes, until such time as the Security Council determines that the objectives of these resolutions have been met,\n\nIn other words, still more of the same.\n\nYou wrote:\n&gt;You do realise that the IAEA is not in Iran right now?\n\nThe IAEA *is* in Iran, but until recently, Iran had refused to allow highly intensive inspections, arguing that the IAEA and Security Council were not negotiating with it in good faith.\n\nHowever, the IAEA and Iran just agreed on a [work plan to address all outstanding issues](http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2007/bog121007.html), suggesting Iran is still interested in transparency despite its treatment by the US.\n\nFurther, the IAEA has stated that [there is no evidence Iran is working on a nuclear weapon](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7068478.stm), but the US and French governments simply dismissed his statement.\n\nUltimately, US (with the assistance of the UK and France) has done everything in its power to prevent Iran and the IAEA from resolving this issue diplomatically. (Mohamed ElBaradei, who had to endure the same tactics in the run-up to the Iraq war, has a hell of a lot more patience than I do.)\n\nIran's cancellation of its Additional Protocol and, more recently, its decision to stop allowing more intensive IAEA inspections, is the intended consequence of the American stick-stick strategy, which is designed to prevent diplomacy from working.\n\nIran is responding quite reasonably to the unreasonable demands placed on it by the US and its allies, who have stated repeatedly that they will not allow Iran to develop nuclear power under any circumstances, define Iran as a terrorist state, and are strategically leaking attack and invasion plans to the media.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02c6eq", "id": "c02c6te", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "politics", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 4, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5zfn7", "retrieved_on": 1427424976, "body": "Read the UNSCR resolutions before commenting further.\r\n\r\nspecifically 1696, 1737 and 1747.\r\n\r\n&gt;What the US is demanding of Iran goes against international law.\r\n\r\nWrong, the law is UNSCR 1696.  \r\n\r\nYou do realise that the IAEA is not in Iran right now?  \r\n\r\nRead the appropriate resolutions on the subject then come back, because right now you are claiming obvious lies.

For example, he said, the panel could take an initial simple-majority vote to suspend the two-thirds-majority rule, then a second simple-majority vote on Iran that would be based on that suspension.\n\nWorld Nuclear Association Director General John Ritch, a former U.S. envoy in Vienna, said in an interview yesterday that a vote would be a mistake.\n\n\u201cApplying the voting procedures that the rules provide for would be technically permissible but highly damaging to the fabric that holds the agency together,\u201d Ritch said. \u201cThe principle of building consensus in the Board of Governors is what has enabled the IAEA to be a highly successful forum for the maintenance of a highly successful nonproliferation regime.\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot imagine,\u201d he added, \u201cthat the Bush administration would be so foolish as to exercise its full rights under the rules.
