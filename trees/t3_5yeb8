It was never about the military fighting wars to make money, it was about people leaving the military to go into business, then using their former connections to see things the military may not want or need pushed through the pentagon and put in troops hands.

During the 60's, there began to be the formation of government sanctioned private companies and charities that operated with the use of ex military personnel.
