Have anxiety therapies and treatments not cured you of your symptoms? Tired of merely coping with anxiety?\r\n\r\nAnxiety, whether temporary or long-term, has the same beginning. Most forms of anxiety disorder are caused by a deep-seated guilt that is being dealt with improperly. While there are countless meditation techniques that will help you cover up the anxiety and guilt, only one will help you expose and remove the original trauma that led to these symptoms.\r\n\r\nOn this free podcast episode, you can hear from two different people who have used the free guided meditation technique to overcome stress and anxiety. Ray bought the book How To Conquer Negative Emotions at a garage sale due to anxiety he was feeling before taking a test. Nada was suffering from anxiety and called up meditation expert Roy Masters on the radio. These are only two out of thousands of testimonials that Roy hears from those who have benefited from the guided meditation.\r\n(Clip from episode: K4706 and K3694)\r\nThis podcast is brought to you by the Foundation of Human Understanding: http://www.fhu.com\r\n\r\nQuotes regarding anxiety and meditation from the book \r\nHow To Conquer Negative Emotions by Roy Masters:\r\n\r\n\"Meditation will not immediately eliminate all your reactions, but it will eliminate your reactions to the existing resentment or fear-anxiety reactions to pressure. You see, resentment produces a debilitating physical conditioning. We resent our inferiority, fear and helplessness, but this only increases the sensitivity of the flesh to stress. After you begin to meditate, you must be patient with your symptoms; learn to experience the humiliation of fear without again resenting either the source or yourself. Once you have successfully resisted this temptation, you are free to observe your other anxieties out of existence. In this way, you will deal effectively with the underlying causes of any symptom. Once you have gone through a series of anxieties like this, you will eventually conquer your conditioned response to pressure completely and feel no response whatever.\"\r\n\r\n\u201cAnxiety is not a bad thing. Don\u2019t try to cope with anxiety. Wait; let it phase back into guilt\u2014but don\u2019t try to do anything about guilt either. Bear it without resentment until it phases back into an understanding of what you have done wrong or what you have failed to do right.\u201d\r\n\r\n\"BE STILL\u2026AND KNOW the pain of anxiety\u2014fears that need to be resolved. Wait to be fulfilled through the infilling of warmth that relieves and revives. Be aware of the tension and edginess caused by resentment. Observe body aches and needs; do not stifle your aching mind and body by reaching for outside comforts. Your needs will be met by the infilling, tingling warmth of God\u2019s grace.\"", "author_flair_css_class": null}
