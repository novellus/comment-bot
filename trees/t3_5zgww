What the article states is that Britain and Poland should be considered for expulsion from the EU. And they have a point.  Both countries have been a fly in the ointment for some years now. Britain still won't embrace the Euro. Poland is happy to accept funding, and have its nationals emplpyed throughout the Eurozone, but then they flip over to do America's bidding (UN resolutions, missile shield). I think expulsion is too strong an action to considere now, but if these countries are only interested in abusing the EU, then, yes, get rid of them.", "author": "ashmodai", "created_utc": "1193784777", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "archived": true, "id": "c02c9ab", "subreddit": "politics", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5zgww", "name": "t1_c02c9ab", "author_flair_css_class": null}
