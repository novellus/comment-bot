Even 6 months ago I was having people tell me to buy a house ASAP, pay the mortgage insurance until the home value appreciated 20%, then re-finance.  Well, if I'd done that, I'd have been SOL, stuck with a house I couldn't refinance and paying far more than an equivalent rental property.  For the majority of even a professional's 20s, responsible home ownership is out of the question without help.  I won't take that help, but I don't begrudge my peers the help they receive.\n\n2) Stagnant (or worse) wage growth: The real minimum wage has declined steadily since I was in high school.  Engineering wages are tracking inflation at best.  The baby boomers have experienced the majority of the gains in income over the last decade.  So, how do the bottom third (or 28%, if you prefer) of 22-29 year olds achieve financial independence?\n\n3) Student loans: You want to break out of the trap of stagnant wages?  You have two choices: be incredibly talented at something with great financial reward, or work really hard and get an advanced degree.  Well, if you do get an advanced degree and you're not exceptional, you're not getting out until you're at least 24 or 25.

Working hard sucks; working hard is not the same as working efficiently. And an education kind of helps to break away from the average wage earner, which equates to a \"good job,\" as I think you are putting it. \n\nGood grades are not necessary, but they help in some instances, for example, by not paying for said education. scholarships are probably easy to come by to individuals with high IQs, as the blogger is claiming to have. People who do well in IQ tests are likely to do well on some other forms of standardized testing.\n\nIs an education necessary? If you are Bill Gates or inherently well liked, business savvy, and extremely lucky, any type of education is a waste of time and money. Obviously, there are only so many Bill Gates distributed among the US population, hence the education bit kind of helps (for the rest of us) to at least break away from the ignorance shackles and the burden of unsatifying working.\n\nMind you that I don't think any less of any type of work, whether manual labour or purely thought-driven careers are what the individual makes them to be: anyone can be creative at anything and be very successful in their own right. \n\nSo my comment to the genius blogger is to not blame the older generations and assume that it's their fault for his failure in a society that offers him everything he needs to accomplish anything he wants. In 20 to 30 years he will be in the shoes of the people he is blaming today. It will be ironic in a way when his children complain to him that having such high-IQ all he could do was to bitch about his parents and uncles who took advantage of what was offered to them (cheap credit, and good salaries after the war).\n\nI still stand by my first comment: stop blaming the previous generation and do what's required. Obviously, if the blogger doesn't know what is required, then all the brain power that he is claiming to have was a waste of genetic mutations and civilization will be well served if nothing is accomplished--call it social Darwinism.\n\nSure, the US is in a state of despair, but so it was in the 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 90s (you get the point)...Life just goes on, and in each era there have been very successful people.

That said, science can tell us that we should be building giantic technological works to deal with the issues at hand, or it might go with with the dirt huts...\n\nHowever, I'm glad you brought up relativism. Relativisim is a very personalized philosophy. It definetly is something that has been mostly isolated to the boomer generation.

Most of the comments in this thread reveal a distinct affiliation with the character traits that the author (be he of a high IQ or not) maligns so greatly.  Whether it is justified or not, I also harbor a mounting resentment towards our parents generation, but not for the reasons the author sites.  \r\n\r\nThe boomers brought the political philosophy of Rosseau into the mainstream, and as a result created a world in whcih relativism, self-obsession, and self-indulgence were not elements of vice, but of virtue.  Restraint, both physical and financial are considered puritannical by the cultural and intellectual icons of the boomer generation.  Not only do we have a right to all of these material goods, sexual debauchery, cosmetic surgery ad infinitum, but according to them, we are entitled to them.  Many will cry foul and downmod or cast aspersions on me for that last sentance, but if so it is only because they have been indoctrinated to think otherwise (as I once was).  The irony is of course is that nobody is taught any more HOW to think, but WHAT to think, and thus the gaping deficit in reflection and thoughtfulness in these threads.\r\nI disagree with the author that their children (my generation and beyond) are somehow going to be able to right the ship.

Well, ironically enough, collectively, this attitude has fucked up the world for everyone.\n\nAs someone from an even younger generation than the orginal article's author, I might have a great personal future, but I'm scared for the world and if anyone is to blame it's people over the age of 40 who have fucked up the entire world with the ignorance and the selfishness.\n\n\"Shit happens, life goes on.\" No... that's the problem. Assuming that life will go on is the attitude that got us here in the first place. We should instead adopt more rational maxims: \"like look before you leap\", \"attend to your mistakes\" and \"be the change that you wish to see in the world\". \"Shit happens, life goes on\" is the sort of thing that people of George Bush's generation will say and try to teach to their kids. And it's the sort of thing that will seriously impede everyone's life in the future.\n\nI might not share the desperation of the fellow who wrote the article, but I certainly share his anger and rage at the culture of selfishness that brought us here.
