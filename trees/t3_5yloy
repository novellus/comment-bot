I'm not sure why it's being down modded.  This has always happened to black people.  Blacks are lumped into some hive-minded monolithic group by larger society.

Now blacks are all thugs.  Look there are no \"black leaders\" are there any white leaders? No one person, or couple of people speak exclusively  for black people.  Blacks are individuals with their own thoughts, feelings, wants, opinions and dreams just like everybody else.  But yes in general Black people want the same shit as everyone else in this country.A safe home ,goods schools, good jobs... a fair shot at what America has to offer.  And the problems faced by black America aren't the fault of rap music.  This shit has been going on for centuries. The misogyny, the violence, the ignorance.  The lust to amass and flash material goods are just the way people (especially americans) are. Those are not black issues, those are human issues.This country was built on greed,theft, violence, sex and murder.  It permeates the very fabric of the American culture; rap music is merely a mirror.  It's a symptom not a cause.  Fix this fucking country and the degradation in the arts will vanish as well. These so- called \"leaders\" need to quit bleating about how rap and thugs are destroying everything and offer some real solutions and then DO them.  Quit running your fucking mouth and put your time and energy and money where your mouth is; put them into social, economic, political, educational programs and movements, internships, schools, movies etc... whatever, that are real proactive solutions that will fix black folks, instead of collecting a check by rubbing a salve over white guilt by blaming the victims. &lt;/rant&gt; ", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c029x6b", "ups": 3, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5yloy", "retrieved_on": 1427426100, "score_hidden": false, "body": "&gt; real black leaders\r\n\r\nIt sure would be nice if you kind white folk would let us know when they hold these elections, so that us blacks can actually vote in them instead of having it decided for us.

To elaborate further on my statement, a \"real leader\" does not have to be famous or rich. It can be the teacher who spends the extra time after school with his/her students, even when it's not required. or the small business owner who sponsors the neighborhood little league team. or the community leaders who lend their time to the young people to keep them off the streets. or the reformed criminal who's learned from his ways, and gives talks to other young men, telling them not to follow down the same mistaken path he did. or maybe the cop who, instead of treating every young black man on the corner as a potential criminal, actually takes the time to get to know the people in the community where he works his regular beat. or the grandmothers, who form and keep up the 'community watch' programs. community leaders, professionals, tutors, mentors, etc. THESE were the 'real black leaders' I was referring to. The ones who don't get the media air time. You won't see them on FOX or CNN because that's not what the mainstream care about. but it doesn't mean they aren't there.\"\n\nthe mainstream won't show you these people. so maybe that's why there are so many \"misinformed\" opinions in response to the original comment, because you all probably think they don't exist.\n\nThe real leaders I was talking about are the ones you see everyday. they have been saying, for years, thug culture is nothing but a corporate scam, and DOING things to make big differences in their own neighborhoods. for the most part it's been working, at least on a music economic scale: most of the people who buy rap music aren't black. and for those who say that people who speak out are put down, i can tell you now, out of experience, you're a liar.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "parent_id": "t1_c029wfu", "id": "c029zcn", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "name": "t1_c029wfu", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "ups": 49, "link_id": "t3_5yloy", "retrieved_on": 1427426110, "id": "c029wfu", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "parent_id": "t3_5yloy", "body": "you think she's the first black person to say this? real black leaders have been saying this for years.", "author_flair_css_class": null}

Certainly gansta rap made a lot more sense in 1988 when 1) it was a small part of the genres of hip hop out there rather than a focus of the record labels and 2) it fit in naturally with the political focus of so much of the hip hop at the time. Straight Outta Compton was actually an interesting counterpoint/companion to It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, to say nothing of 3 Feet High and Rising.\n\nIn 1988, it was easy to see the genre as a critique and expression of anger. In 2007, as braggadocio rap has been mostly swallowed by gangsta rap and Big Willie-ism and Puffy-style has become the point of the exercise, well, not so much.\n\nStill, there's always Mos Def, The Coup, and those folks.

People should be able to make music about whatever they want.  And  crime-rap like the Clipse album, \"Hell Hath No Fury\" is an instant classic in my book.  That life is out there.

In the same way, why shouldn't there be a game that reflects the violent choices real life offers?\n\nI think the problem is the prevalence of that type of rap.  There isn't much balance in the types of rap songs that make it to the radio.      Rap featuring violence, conspicuous consumption, parties, and the objectification of women get more airplay and those rappers are rewarded.  Then, more people want to rap that way.
