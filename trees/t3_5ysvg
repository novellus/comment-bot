Pine is entering dangerous acting territory.  If he does the Shatner version of Kirk (the imitation of which thrives in American popular culture) he will be panned; you can't out-Shatner Shatner, and any attempt will fail miserably.  If he does anything else - if he attempts to just play Kirk, and not play Shatner playing Kirk - some people will still feel let down.\n\nI feel like I've been thinking about this waaaay more than I should, but what are the essential qualities of Captain Kirk?
