There is really no way to reliably provide good low-latency service for VOIP and gaming on the same link as FTP without prioritizing packets.\n\nWhat the author misses is that we are not talking about traffic shaping.  Comcast is actively breaking connections.\n\nIntroducing competition sounds like a great idea and I would welcome it, but it will never fix this problem.
