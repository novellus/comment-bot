The numbers used to display things on your screen are also stored in memory (often called video RAM).  It was quite common for video and program RAM to be one in the same thing back then and hence you could use the video RAM to store programs.  \n\nOf course, that would mean that the program would 'appear' on the screen as random characters or graphics.\n\nThe stack is a special list of numbers used by programs to keep track of 'where they've been' so that they can get back there.  It's very common for programs to be going along in a linear fashion do this, do that, do another thing and then go off to another place (sometimes called a CALL) to do some common task called a sub-routine.  For example, a common sub-routine might be used to make the speaker on your computer beep.\n\nSince the sub-routine doesn't know who CALLed it (where they are stored in the computer's RAM) the stack is used.  Just before the program CALLs the sub-routine it places its current location in RAM on the top of the stack.  When the sub-routine has finished it looks at the top item on the stack (called popping it) so that it knows where the program wants to carry on.\n\nIt's a stack because a sub-routine might call a sub-routine and so on.  Each would push and pop so that there's a perfect record of where to go back to.\n\nIf the stack was stored in the video RAM then you'd actually be able to see it on screen (as random characters) and if you were to alter that part of the screen (e.g. fly your spaceship onto it) then you'd mess up the stack, sub-routines would go back to the wrong place and all hell would let loose.\n\nIn modern times when people talk about the security problem of 'buffer overflows' they are often talking about messing up this stack to force all hell to let loose.\n\nJohn.\n\n(*) I can give details of my sexual history as well, but only on nsfw.reddit.com, and it does involve quite a bit of pushing and popping, too.", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1427424989, "subreddit_id": "t5_2fwo", "archived": true, "name": "t1_c02c5hu", "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5zf41", "downs": 0, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02c5hu", "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": "1193753541", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "programming", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_c02c53g", "body": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2fwo", "ups": -43, "name": "t1_c02c53g", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5zf41", "retrieved_on": 1427424993, "score_hidden": false, "body": "can anyone explain what this means for those of us who didn't graduate college as a virgin", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5zf41", "id": "c02c53g", "author_flair_css_class": null}
