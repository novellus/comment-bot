I have several that I have been personally involved in. If you like I will share.\n\n*I* can think of several cases that involve me/my family/my friends have been ripped off,  even having insurance.\n\nFor example my mom was rear-ended by a drunk, uninsured driver, and was sent by ambulance to the hospital. She was insured and her health insurance company (she actually had me call Aetna) initially told her they would pay per the plan. She jumped through the hoops, they required her to pay many of the charges upfront, and then they denied her claim about a month later citing \"preexisting condition\".\n\nShe was unsuccessful in finding a lawyer that would take the case due to having to prove that she didn't have a preexisting condition in her neck.\n\nGuess what they cited as the preexisting. No, seriously, I want you to guess, because it's idiotic.\n\nI have other examples of this, one includes the infamous \"have to call to get permission to use the ambulance while unconscious\" story. \n\nSo we are at an impasse. But the millions of people without insurance or are under-insured remain.\n\n&gt;I currently have no insurance. If I get sick or get a minor boo boo that needs stiches, I go to any one of several urgent care clinics that charge 85 dollars per visit.\n\nIt'll be alot more then that. $85 is the consultation fee, not the actual care fee.\n\n&gt;In my search for hotshot surgeons in the U.S. I came across several cases of athletes from countries with socialized medicine coming to the states for surgery.\n\nThen that's fine, can 80% of the people that live in America get those same treatments? If not then that fact that they come here doesn't matter. Having the best of the best doctors doesn't help you for example. Also, what procedures were these? Was it cosmetic or sports related? Because yea, I sure do think that that's what socialized medicine should be spending it's money on.\n\n&gt;My problem with socialized anything, is if something is offered for \"free\", it becomes an entitlement that gets poorly managed and taken advantage of by criminals.\n\nAnd your preferred system in the real world would not also be taken advantage of or it wouldn't be poorly managed?\n\nIf you don't think so on either account then you are diluted.\n\n&gt;People must be made responsible for themselves first.\n\nThen still have people pay small amounts. That's what single payer is all about. Hell, make it more expensive then other systems like the UK. Make it $30 a RX, free scheduled doctor check-ups, $10 clinic non emergency, and $80 emergany (free if admitted inpatient). \n\nThat's the one thing I love about America (in both private and public sectors) that seems to get tripped over when dealing with healthcare. America takes the best ideas in the world and makes them so good it would be more work to perfect it. Yea, we have corruption, but *every* system does. Let's find a way to make socialized medicine work, take the best ideas out there and make them work.\n\n&gt;You know that we have an extensive federal socialized system of medicine in th U.S. now, and the states have their own systems of socialized medicine as well. All are poorly run and subject to fraud because there is no incentive in a socialized system to stop it.\n\nPoorly run?\n\n[Check this out](http://72.14.205.104/search?q=cache:T-hBeVN0zywJ:archive.prospect.org/archives/archives/2006/01/index.html+%22THE+MOUSTACHE+OF+MISUNDERSTANDING%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a)\n\nLook for the highlighting.", "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c029y96", "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": "t1_c029xjk", "name": "t1_c029y96", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "name": "t1_c029xjk", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_2z18r", "retrieved_on": 1427426096, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c029xjk", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c029wy1", "body": "Maybe we should address the problems that make health care so expensive.
