All of its other functionality remains. You can still scroll up without difficulty, and knowing how near the 'bottom' of 5000 results you are is pretty useless.\n\nUsing pageless pagination does not STOP you from putting a next link for those without javascript. Only stupid website writers (and of those, there are many) assume javascript exists.\n\nAnd I've never seen Jacob Nielsen recommend that you have to be able to bookmark a specific page in a search result. This a silly edge functionality that very, very few people use. They bookmark results 99% of the time, and most of the other 1% they are bookmarking the first page of the search. I'm sure there's a marginal tiny fraction who bookmark a later page, but with pageless pagination, EVERY page is the first page... so nothing is BROKEN. They can still bookmark the search like usual, and scroll down to the result they want. Since search results can move, this is probably in improvement in the usability.\n\nFinally, these detractors are not even paying attention to the most important fact... 90% of people NEVER PAGE. They never see the second page of results. The difference in number of clicks from the 10th result on google, and the 11th, is **massive**, because most people never get to page 2.

The combination of scrolling and pagination on data displays is clunky.\n\nFourth: there is precisely one way in which paged displays can be nice. That is, fit the height of one page precisely in one window and make the space bar or pagedown key turn to the next page. AND DO NOT USE A SCROLLBAR.
