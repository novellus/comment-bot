(Ask me how I know!)\n\nThe reason why is that we all know that quality outdoor-grown in the forests of  Sonoma, Lake, Mendocino, Trinity, Humboldt and Del Norte Counties is probably the finest in the world.  There are hydro strains that are more potent in terms of pure THC content, but for quality of taste, for refinement, for subtleties born of complex soils and micro-climates, you  simply cannot fuck with Northern Californian weed.  We see a similar effect in wine and beer, but while there are many other regions that produce wines and beers comparable to those of Northern California, the same is not true of pot.  I have traveled the world and I am here to tell you that for taste and refinement, Northern California weed is the best there is, hands down, no questions asked.

It posits, incredibly, that when an agent of the federal government comes to visit you in your home or at your school or at your place of work and asks you if you use drugs that you are going to answer truthfully.\n\nThink about that.  They're basically asking you to confess to felony violations of federal law.  And then when everybody says no, they run around trumpeting the numbers as though they are \"winning\" the war on drugs.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that they are in direct control over these numbers.  The only that is being measured is the willingness of people to place themselves in jeopardy by answering these questions.  By controlling the level of propaganda being put out there, they can raise or lower this number to suit their policy objective.\n\nIf it is felt that legalization forces are gaining ground, they ratchet up the propaganda to make fewer people respond in the affirmative, and hence make it look like the war on drugs is working.\n\nBut when budget levels fall perilously low, the propaganda is pulled back, the numbers rise, and the drug warriors can point to \"increased drug use\" and get more money from Congress.\n\nMeanwhile, the true rate of drug use remains unknown.\n\nIt is the greatest atrocity of all time, what these people are doing.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
