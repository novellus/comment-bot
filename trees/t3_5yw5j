A longer date range simply produces stronger evidence that a century of continuous annual increases in oil production has come to an end, precisely when market signals call for more increases to meet still-growing demand.\n\nSaudi Arabia's oil production fell by eight percent last year, mainly on declines in production from its aging Ghawar field, which requires seven million barrels a day of seawater injection to produce less than seven million barrels of oil.\n\nKuwait admitted last year that it only has 50 billion barrels, not 100 billion barrels as it had previously claimed.\n\nNorth Sea oil production has been falling by 8-10 percent a year.\n\nMexico's Cantarell field peaked two years ago and is declining rapidly. Its other oil supplies are small or far offshore, limiting their potential rate of production.\n\nIraq is long past its production peak. Even without all the political instability there, it could not produce more than around 3.5 million barrels a day (compared to the 2-2.5 million barrels it's producing right now).\n\nIran is a couple of decades past its production peak and declining slowly but steadily (which is why they're investing in nuclear power).\n\nVenezuela is past its production peak for conventional oil, and rate of production for its non-conventional oil is severely constrained by technical limitations.\n\nThe US passed its production peak in 1971 and has been declining ever since.\n\nCanada passed its conventional production peak, and its non-conventional oil is subject to similar limits to rate of production as Venezuela.\n\nThe few oil supplies coming on-line these days are small, far off-shore, non-conventional (oilsands or shale), sour, heavy, and hard to reach. In other words, it's going to get progressively harder and harder to get the stuff to market, which is precisely what we're starting to experience.\n\nGlobal light, sweet crude production already peaked a few years ago, and as sour, heavy crude plus non-conventional oil makes up a bigger share of the total, the rate of production will fall simply because it's harder to extract and harder to refine.\n\nStop it with the \"coincidence theorist\" straw man attack and look at what's going on: the data I linked to come directly from the EIA, produced by the US government. A large number of independent geologist, economists, energy investment bankers and even oil companies have come to the same conclusion: we're going to have to learn to do more with less.\n\nThe difference between now and the 1970s is that the previous oil crisis was mainly political in origin, whereas today's crisis is mainly geological. Instability in the middle east may bump futures prices by $10 or so, but the fundamentals of rising demand and constrained supply have still produced a high and rising price that will not be alleviated except by some kind of demand destruction.", "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c02ars9", "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c02ars9", "parent_id": "t1_c02ap2x", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c02ap2x", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "ups": 0, "link_id": "t3_5yw5j", "retrieved_on": 1427425738, "body": " What evidence?
