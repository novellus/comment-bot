Kent in the phone book, nor any people with the same last name with a similar street number. A quick search on Canada Posts website reveals the postal code to be valid on a nearby street\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI suspect the package was purposely misdirected to this address in case the authorities caught on. I also suspect that the recepient owns an unsecured mailbox that anyone can get into. Either one of the victims picked up the mail ahead of schedule, or the perpetrator forgot to fetch it from the mail before the victims got home. The people doing this most likely live nearby and are home most of the day. They are on the same route, so they know when the victim gets their mail. They then simply walk by and snatch up the package with all the crazy stickers on it. Funny thing is, this use of their mail box as an impromptu annonymous mail drop may have been going on for awhile now without the victims ever knowing about it. The only issue remaining is; how long before that vacuum bag springs a big leak? It looks so damn yummy packed like that. It's kind of irresistable -- like bubble wrap.", "author": "MyaloMark", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_5yz8n", "id": "c02azfu", "author_flair_css_class": null}
