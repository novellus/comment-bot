It turns out, architecture is not about the ego or the self. It is far more complex than that: it now is more obvious and tangible to be relevant in a supermodernist age, architecture has to blur traditional boundaries to cope with this global culture. Even more impossible for the amateur to pierce: the irony of themselves declaring themselves heroic. Talent and actions may be one thing but on a level of considering it cynically as being ironic, here you're overestimating the writer and the characters.\n\nWhile our buddy, our hero, Howard Roarke may have been heroic, there was no sense of irony in it. It was all very plain and straightforward. It was inspiring to see the rejection of the critic as not a doer but a manipulator. This is all very nice and neat and clean. And, in fact, Philip Johnson is arguably the curatorial leach that this was based upon. He brought the icy clean international style to the forefront. Frank Lloyd Wright sputtered damnations against this style. And, it is fairly well accepted that FLW was the model which Roarke was based on.\n\nAgain, please illustrate where the irony lies here. It all seemed pretty much like glorification of Roarke, his stoicism, his muse, whatever. Those who were lacking his integrity, his certain Gary Cooperness, his everydayamericanmaness, pretty much disintegrated themselves.\n\nThat is just a flat-out morality tale.\n\nBoring, now that I think back. I mean, it was not boring when I read it. I actually consider it a motivating piece and was a pageturner. But all that sort of socialist utopian stuff by Rand or the dystopic futurehells like Aldous Huxley's Brave New World seem not that sophisticated compared to the truth. \n\nThe truth is Roarke was maybe only compelling in his sort of terseness. Like Eastwood in a Leone film or Mifune in Kirusowa's, the maxim holds, \"He who speaks first, loses. He who speaks most, loses.\" All the pathetic caricatures dwindled off until there was none. Roarke wins because every one else was a poseur, a fake, a wimp, whatever. But good does not always triumph. \n\nReally, something more complex, like say the Brothers Karamazov, might register some sense of the ironic. The amount of pain tearing every single character up all for the sake of family, ah, how sweet to kill your father!\n\nAll right, I am done being a dick.", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "name": "t1_c02aqv3", "parent_id": "t1_c02apu7", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "score_hidden": false, "ups": -5, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5ywdh", "retrieved_on": 1427425729, "id": "c02apu7", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02apu7", "parent_id": "t3_5ywdh", "body": "The Fountainhead, by Ayn Rand.\nAn ironic novel, where the hero's main enemy is the author herself.", "author_flair_css_class": null}

Why such myths cling tenaciously for so long in the popular (and specialist) imagination is a subject for another thread.\n\n* *Darkness at Night: A Riddle of the Universe* by Edward R. Harrison. So why is the sky dark at night? The answers given in many pop-sci books, and also in quite a few textbooks, are wrong or at best nowhere near right enough. Cosmological expansion, the finite age of the universe, the spatial distribution of stars ... all these commonly suggested factors are overridden into near insignificance by the mother of all reasons: the energy density of the universe is too low to make a bright night sky. This book is a great way to exercise your skeptical mind and learn a fair amount of cosmology in the process.\n\n* *The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal* by James Franklin.  There are [many myths](http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/medmyths.html) about the Middle Ages, and the net effect of these myths is a big hole of ignorance (affecting even the more educated among us) regarding medieval contributions to modern civilisation and science. This book deals with the rational methods that were developed during the middle ages to deal with uncertainty and risk. Probability was subsequently put on a firmer mathematical foundation by Pascal and Fermat, but they were informed by the centuries-old work of medieval scholars.\n\n* *McClellan's War: The Failure of Moderation in the Struggle for the Union* by Ethan S. Rafuse. For over a century, George B. McClellan has been the favourite whipping-boy for the radical Republican narrative that came to dominate American civil war history, especially the history concerning the Army of the Potomac. This book seeks to understand the political and social environment in which McClellan was raised, and in doing so, it makes sense of his generalship during the war and overturns some of the many myths about him. It seems that not only is truth a casualty of war, but so is reason and moderation.", "author_flair_css_class": null}

Piling idea upon idea will probably eventually open your mind. Collecting more information about the world is the primary driving force behind the expansion and restructuring of consciousness. That and the courage to confront the cognitive dissonance this generates.\n\nI don't disagree with the dynamic you describe.  It does take place, and when a person doesn't know what they are doing, it is a primary way of opening the mind.  It's haphazard in its operation.  People have ways to cope with the cognitive dissonance while avoiding dealing with it.\n\nAnother problem with that method is that if you rely on just 1 well placed assumption, you can build a solid layer or ideas and world models on top of it without generating much cognitive dissonance.  If you have to rely on a 100 assumptions, it may be impossible to avoid serious cognitive dissonance.  But, as the number of assumptions dwindles down to single digits, cognitive dissonance is no longer a reliable feature of consciousness.  I guess you could say you're fairly open-minded at that point, but I would disagree, because even one assumption can produce a limitless array of consequences.\n\nI would only call a person open-minded if they have begun to question the root of all concepts (the identity principle).  If the person is not yet questioning the root of all concepts, it's not an open-minded person.\n\nFor example, if a person has just one assumption like \"matter exists\", he/she can have a very coherent world view with almost no cognitive dissonance.  That's why it's very hard to eliminate a materialistic mindset -- you cannot point to some glaringly obvious inconsistency, you may have to examine the identity principle at that point.\n\nJust what kind of books would a materialist need to read to break out of that mindset?  Keep in mind, people do not enjoy reading things that directly challenge their world views.  So it has to be fun and yet it has to produce a cognitive dissonance.

I'm an electronic engineer, son of a mechnical engineer, so I've always viewed lawyers as parasites, but Farnsworth has shaken up my world view.\n\nBack in 1776 Adam Smith suggested three conditions, together sufficient for a nation to become wealthy: peace, low taxes, and a tolerably exact administration of justice. Farnsworth persuades me that the administration of justice is difficult and that good law and good lawyers make a substation positive contribution to wealth. \n\nA real eye opener is The Logic Of Collective Action by Mancur Olson. Like many a classic it is heavy going and I've failed to finish it. However when he published it in 1965 it overturned traditional wisdom about how the world works and the implications of his insights are still filtering through to the world at large.\n\nMy third suggestion for mind blowing reading matter achieves profound weirdness by means of excessive orthodoxy. Economists have had some success in understanding the economy. The insights of Smith into the division of labour and Ricardo into comparative advantage have implications that were contrary to the common sense of their day and have yet to be assimilated into our popular wisdom.\n\nSimply buy an undergraduate economics text book, such as Principles of Economics by Gregory Mankiw, and accept the \"orthodoxy\". This will take you into a looking glass world.
