I've seen martial arts masters who were really superb physically, but then they think they can do action at a distance stuff, and it's clear it's all the power of suggestion. They can only do it with people who really believe, usually their own students.\n\nWhere I take martial arts there are some moves or positions that are supposed to give me some kind of \"chi feeling\". The teacher and some the higher level students always ask me if I can feel it, and I'm like \"Uh, no.\"\n\nBut the rest of the instruction is at such a high level, I continue to put up with it. And pressure points are just places where it's easy to pinch a nerve. They really work, but there's nothing mystical about them. Well, not any more mystical than Being itself.\n\nI think Chi is a concept that embodies certain states of physical being, for example, if you have good Chi in a technique, it means you are able to perfectly align your body at the right moment and with the right amount of force to achieve maximum effect. I've even done that, you can knock somebody over and hardly feel like you've done anything.\n\nBut all that Chi ball stuff - I wonder if it could even be a case of mutual suggestion. Like, the master says he can do it, the student believes it and so is affected by it, so then the master believes he really did it.\n", "author": "mutatron", "created_utc": "1193202378", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5yzgh", "id": "c02azan", "author_flair_css_class": null}
