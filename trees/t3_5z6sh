Rancho San Diego. Mission Gorge. Even La Jolla. UTC. Clairmont Mesa. \n\nAll are major cities in San Diego, and all are next to a Major Freeway. All except Fallbrook are in the normal Metro area of San Diego. \n\nthey are ALL - ALL -  Surrounded, or bordered on one side by wild canyons.  Here in San Diego, we don't usually build in the canyons. the flames build up int he back country (Ramona, Jamul, etc), come up or down a canyon into the metro area, build up heat and force, and up onto the Plateau where the houses are, at the top of the canyon, driven by Santa Ana Winds.  it kills those houses, the embers go a few rows of houses in, and lights those on fire, and it then slowly gets held back, because it goes from being a canyon fire, which is impossible to stop, to housing fires, which they can begin to control.  Then the wind dies down, humidity returns, and the fires are much easier to contain without a 60 MPH wind pushing them. \n\nHere's 1  canyon where it jumped the 15. the other one is to the north. Some houses faired okay, some did poorly. ALL had tile roofs on this side of the freeway. Many houses were lost to the right, and further right across the freeway from this quick shot. \n\nhttp://www.javbw.com/photos_hidden/october2007fires/escala_drive_and_15North.jpg\n\nThe fire continues down the canyon, while the edges stop to nibble houses off the edges of the cities, and it skips along to the next area bordering another city.  the Witch Creek fire burned about 200,000 acres so far, and much of it was skipping from one developed area to the next. Via the canyon that Ramona sits in that goes all the way to rancho Santa Fe.  that's how it got down there.  right through the top of RB, and smashed up against Poway. \n\nEveryone of these neighborhoods sits next to or in the middle of these canyons. the views or the inability to build in canyons places them on the edge.

It made a wall of flame about 300 feet high when it came over Lyons.  her Log Cabin - made form 12\" logs - was no match for that kind of flame. \n\nhere's a huey trying to defend houses nearby - the huey is still a mile or so from the flames on the other side of the ridge in this shot. This was Tuesday, and all this land in the foreground is now burned. \n\nhttp://www.javbw.com/photos_hidden/october2007fires/Fire_helicopter_huey.jpg\n\nBTW - Coastal Sage develops a chemical similar to kerosene in it's leaves after 15 or so years - to help fires go - to Germinate their seeds.   \n\nMaybe learn to use \"teh google\" before you open your mouth.

It's really irrelevant to the topic, since the overall design of the house plays a much bigger role in temperature control than what it's made out of.\n\nA typically constructed stucco wall has a [fire resistance rating](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire-resistance_rating) of [one hour](http://www.cement.org/stucco/faq_fire_rating.asp).\n\nThat means it would take an hour for the air on the internal side of the wall to reach 180 degrees Fahrenheit , still nowhere near hot enough to spontaneously ignite wooden studs.\n\nSo I think it can be agreed upon that if your house in built in the middle of a dry forest out of anything but concrete and steel, it's probably going to be gone or at least very badly damaged. If you're in a more suburban area with less vegetation, there's a good chance building a house with its exterior made of plaster or stucco will survive quickly passing fires, even if they do come in direct contact with the walls.", "id": "c02bln6", "author": "madmax_br5", "created_utc": "1193450088", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "ups": 9, "parent_id": "t1_c02bk9v", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "name": "t1_c02bk9v", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "ups": 19, "link_id": "t3_5z6sh", "retrieved_on": 1427425264, "id": "c02bk9v", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02bjzv", "body": "I lived in a stucco house in southern california for 20 years, and it sure as hell needed air conditioning.
