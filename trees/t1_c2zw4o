It's not about UI as such, it's about whether the WM exposes enough information programatically so that it is possible to access it in unexpected ways, for instance without a keyboard, or without a mouse, or without a screen. GNOME isn't perfect in these terms, Orca (the GNOME screen reader) is not yet a credible accessibility solution for day-to-day use. KDE doesn't even try, or at least it looks that way from the outside.\r\n\r\nI don't mind terminals, btw, terminasl are very very accessible technology for the most.\r\n", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "programming", "name": "t1_c029ppg", "parent_id": "t1_c2zw4o", "ups": 1, "author_flair_css_class": null}
