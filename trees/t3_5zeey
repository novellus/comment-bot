But this argument is tired and simplistic.  Demographic decline was responsible, in large part, for the de-urbanization of Europe in the early medieval period . . . and one natural consequence of de-urbanization was a decline in urban learning centers, where classical education had dwelt for centuries.  Christianity, if anything, helped preserve much of the knowledge of classical antiquity.  The overwhelming majority of our documents and texts from antiquity are actually medieval copies, which should provide a clue that the Middle Ages weren't just a dark pit of human ignorance.  Also, there was no real \"Renaissance.\"  The reintroduction of Greek materials into western Europe was gradual, though there was a marked surge in 1453, with the exodus of Byzantine scholars.  For the most part, though, the idea of a \"renaissance\" was borne of a (quite successful) PR campaign to distance certain aspects of early modern Europe from its medieval past.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
