Many recent explanations call on greater carbon storage in a poorly ventilated deep ocean during glacial periods1\u20135, but direct evidence regarding the ventilation and respired carbon\ncontent of the glacial deep ocean is sparse and often equivocal6.\n\nHere we present sedimentary geochemical records from sites spanning the deep subarctic Pacific that\u2014together with previously published results7\u2014show that a poorly ventilated water mass containing\na high concentration of respired carbon dioxide occupied the North Pacific abyss during the Last Glacial Maximum. Despite\nan inferred increase in deep Southern Ocean ventilation during the first step of the deglaciation (18,000\u201315,000 years ago)4,8, we\nfind no evidence for improved ventilation in the abyssal subarctic Pacific until a rapid transition 14,600 years ago: this change was\naccompanied by an acceleration of export production from the surface waters above but only a small increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration8. \n\nWe speculate that these changes were mechanistically linked to a roughly coeval increase in deep water formation in the North Atlantic9\u201311, which flushed respired carbon dioxide from northern abyssal waters, but also increased the supply of nutrients to the upper ocean, leading to greater carbon dioxide sequestration at mid-depths and stalling the rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. \n\nOur findings are qualitatively consistent with hypotheses invoking a deglacial flushing of respired carbon dioxide from an isolated, deep ocean reservoir1\u20135,12, but suggest that the reservoir may have been released in stages, as vigorous deep water ventilation switched between North Atlantic and Southern Ocean source regions.
