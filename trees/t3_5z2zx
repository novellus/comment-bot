It introduces three chemicals into the body: an anesthetic (like sodium thiopental), a paralytic agent\n\nI think the paralytic agent mostly just gives the illusion of a peaceful death.  If the other two drugs are truly gentle then why paralyze the subject?  The same is used in most surgeries to keep a patient still even if they wake up.  And they wake up *often*.  The anesthetist (commonly a nurse, only distantly \"supervised\" by the doctor who gives you the fat bill, in cheap ass USA hospitals) can only detect distress in the patient by looking for increased heart rate.  Good luck getting any compensation if this happens to you.  While potentially horrific for an unsuspecting hospital patient it doesn't sound too bad during an execution when compared to death by fire or hungry rats.\n   ", "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5z2zx", "name": "t1_c02b8ef", "author_flair_css_class": null}
