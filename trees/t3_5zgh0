Don't take any tests in the field. No breathalyser, you're not required to take it in the field (in California). Don't let him shine things in your eyes, or instruct you to walk lines.  You do not have to comply with any field tests.\n   3. If you go to jail, take a blood test. He has to wait for the results, so he'll write the report without knowing that you failed it. He has to worry about being honest, since if you pass the test he's made a false arrest. Blood samples can be re-tested by another party later, breathalyser tests cannot.\n   4. If you've been doing drugs (not drinking) take the urine test, it's the most inaccurate.\n   5. Use all three of your (completed) phone calls. Call a lawyer.
