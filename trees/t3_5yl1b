If there is a 'message' in terrorism, it is not directed at the target of the act, but rather at allies or potential allies of the terrorists.  Osama wasn't trying to send the USA a message, he was trying to send his fellow Muslims a message.  That message reads something like this: 'Arab countries control the world's oil, and yet we do not control the world or even the middle east.  Unite and spread radical Islam to the world!  It can be done; see, we can strike at the USA.'  As long as you think that the terrorists are trying to communicate WITH US, you will misunderstand them.\n\n&gt; No, it doesn't. You are confusing causality and responsibility. If the USA blows up an innocent man's family, and he joins a terrorist organization in response and ends up killing Americans, then the USA was a primary cause, and the man bears the responsibility.\n\nI'm pretty sure I'm not confusing causality and responsibility.  If you are responsible for something then you can be blamed for it.  If you are not responsible for something then you SHOULD NOT be blamed for it. In your above example, the USA should not be blamed, because it is the man's *choice* to join the terrorist organization.   However, the I-Am-The-Cause-Of-All-Evil camp will see the historical context of the terrorists actions and immediately blame themselves.  This is bad for two reasons: 1st. People get tired of hearing that they are sinners pretty fast, and stop listening.  2nd. It becomes an excuse to justify the actions of the terrorist, people think: 'Because we're to blame, he's not the problem.' That conclusion is false, because it is based upon a false assignment of blame.\n\n&gt; And I have never said otherwise. But that doesn't mean that the USA can't be a primary cause for those terrorist attacks.\n\nBy that reasoning the USA is the 'primary cause' for almost everything that happens in the world, because it either is the direct result of our actions, results from our actions by indirect 'primary causality', or could have been prevented by some action we did not take.  For somebody who's just a little less intellectually fastidious, and doesn't recognize the distinction between causality and responsibility, this sort of reasoning can be used to blame the USA for EVERYTHING!

A hundred people who hate the USA is not the same as a billion people who hate the USA.  Saying \"well there'll always be *somebody* who hates the USA\" is avoiding the issue that the USA's foreign policy is making *more and more* people hate the USA, and that's not as meaningless as you imply.\n\n&gt; For example, imagine 2 sides of a local conflict. Both sides see that the USA is powerful enough to take their side to victory... if the USA allies with one side it angers the other, if it allies with neither side it angers both...\n\nThere is a difference between anger and hatred.  You think people would throw their lives away to attack the USA for not getting involved?  They may very well *resent* the USA for it, but that is a long way from hatred.\n\n&gt; The 'Don't make enemies.' ideal of foreign policy just can't work for large countries. Once one accepts this fact, it becomes more important to be able to mitigate/defeat enemies than prevent their formation (which is inevitable regardless).\n\nHow about \"try to avoid making enemies\"?  Just because an extremely bad thing cannot be avoided 100%, it doesn't mean you should just shrug your shoulders and accept 0%.\n\nMaking enemies may or may not be inevitable.  But the USA has a lot of control over the *number* and *type* of enemies that it makes.\n\nQuite frankly, I think that it's a sign of how far the USA has fallen that there are people like you who seem to believe that people hating you to the point where they are willing to *blow themselves up just to piss you off* is a normal, unavoidable part of life.  It's not.  It's a fucking catastrophe.\n\n&gt; Would those terrorist attacks be horrible and unforgivable things to do? Of course! But that doesn't mean the USA's actions wouldn't have been a primary cause...\n\n&gt; Yes it does.\n\nNo, it doesn't.  You are confusing causality and responsibility.  If the USA blows up an innocent man's family, and he joins a terrorist organisation in response and ends up killing Americans, then the USA was a primary cause, and the man bears the responsibility.\n\n&gt; the responsibility for the future terrorist attacks that you envision will lie with the terrorists themselves.\n\nAnd I have never said otherwise.  But that doesn't mean that the USA can't be a primary cause for those terrorist attacks.\n", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c029yzh", "id": "c029z58", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 1, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5yl1b", "retrieved_on": 1427426077, "id": "c029yzh", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c029yzh", "parent_id": "t1_c029y7u", "body": "&gt; Do you really think this is some kind of self-hatred kick?\n\nYes, I do.

Doesn't matter what policies it has or doesn't have there will always be people who hate it for there own reasons.  (For example, imagine 2 sides of a local conflict.  Both sides see that the USA is powerful enough to take their side to victory... if the USA allies with one side it angers the other, if it allies with neither side it angers both... they will hold the USA responsible for not doing what they think it should have.)\n\nThe 'Don't make enemies.' ideal of foreign policy just can't work for large countries.

It is the difference between context and causality.  \n\nFor example, Osama caused 911; we responded by defeating the Talaban and Sadam.  That doesn't mean that Osama is responsible for toppling the Taliban or Sadam!  His actions might have been the context in which we chose to act, but the choice to act was ours, so the responsibility for those actions is ours.
