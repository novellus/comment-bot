If I can do that, while reading my laptop on the jawn, why can't you ??? :) Anyway, it confirms what I have heard other military intelligence types say, these methods really miss the point. Much better is to do what police investigators and other intelligence people have done, entrap the subject with repeated questions about their story, find inconsistencies and try to entrap them with their own statements until you find the truth. Problem is, that takes time, but the other stuff just doesn't yield anything of value, so you don't really save time :\n\n\"Meet, for example, retired Air Force Col. John Rothrock, who, as a young captain, headed a combat interrogation team in Vietnam. \"if I take a Bunsen burner to the guy's genitals, he's going to tell you just about anything,\" which would be pointless. Rothrock, who is no squishy liberal, says that he doesn't know \"any professional intelligence officers of my generation who would think this is a good idea.\"\" (http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A2302-2005Jan11.html) .\n\nThere are other people commenting on that article, too. In the Google search you may find dissenting opinions as well (ie torture works), so if you want your question answered, go to it and make up your own mind. My opinion is that George Bush and Rumsfeld don't really fully understand the nature of the terrorist threat and its distributed nature, hence the Iraq invasion and the support for these interrogation methods. Both of these things might work in a war against an army, but here it drives more moderates to the extremists, so creates more terrorists, and more importantly  it enflames the terrorist network that exists in about *60* countries, not just Iraq. This network is NOT a standing WW II style Army with a base in Iraq. Young conservative radical religious muslim types join it at will all over the world. You can either marginalize it or strengthen it. Invading Iraq made about as much sense as invading Turkey, both countries were Muslim but that's about it. Let's see, do you think that action inflamed, strengthened or weakened the terrorist network ? Hmmmmm.... \n\nGo after the network, but politically be smart, don't declare a war that kills muslim civilians for the whole world to see, thats counterproductive. You want these folks on your side politically. Militarily fight the extremist network, use police, courts, military, whatever, but don't declare extremists \"warriors\" and make a big deal of it. Treat going after terrorists like a routine thing. Politically, keep muslims separate from the extremists and look at the political concerns of that society. They have a lot to be grieved about. Address those concerns, work with them as allies, while at the same time going after the extremists. That's how you weaken the network and its by the way the whole Petreaus strategy from what I understand (in Iraq only, however, when it really would make sense for the whole \"War on Terror\" (what a stupid, counterproductive name by the way, it makes terrorists \"warriors\" (I bet they like that !) and Bush blurts it out any chance he gets, what a an idiot, just great...)).", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "created_utc": "1193201138", "ups": 1, "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5yxav", "retrieved_on": 1427425607, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02az7s", "author": "frenchguy", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c02az7s", "parent_id": "t1_c02atne", "body": "Torture has been tried before, very openly, and with good conscience, for example during Inquisition; using torture, you can get people to tell you they have met the Devil himself and talked to him, or that they have supernatural powers, etc.\n\nUS torturing people is a lot like Inquisition: we are the good guys, and are you with the Devil?

I agree there's a basic problem that's very difficult to deal with.  Namely: \n\n1) Religion is very important and central to many people's lives. \n\n2) Islam (and Christianity) is a religion that advocates there is only one true god.\n\n3) People like to be right, all the time.  This means that someone else must be wrong in cases of monotheistic religions, for one extreme philosophical state can't exist without the other.\n\nThese three things automatically make any non-tolerant, monotheistic religion a combative one, because it becomes a mission to eliminate all of the \"lies\" from the world and bring everyone into the fold.\n\nIn this, I think you're correct, one cannot address the current world conflict without addressing Islam, and to ignore that would be detrimental.

We are different from all the oligarchies of the past, in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means, it is an end.
