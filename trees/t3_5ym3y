He set a clock on a wall at midnight, and lay down on the floor under a leaning sheet of glass. Viewers came and went. Burden didn\u2019t move. Inevitably, he soiled his pants. (\u201cIt was awful,\u201d he recalled.) Forty-five hours and ten minutes passed. Then a young museum employee named Dennis O\u2019Shea took it upon himself to place a container of water within Burden\u2019s reach. The artist got up, smashed the clock with a hammer, and left. He never again undertook a public action that imperilled himself. It wouldn\u2019t have made sense. \u201cDoomed\u201d unmasked the absurdity of the conventions by which, through assuming the role of viewers, we are both blocked and immunized from ethical responsibility. In O\u2019Shea\u2019s case, the situation was complicated by his duty to maintain the inviolability of art works. There should be a monument to him, somewhere, which would commemorate the final calling of the bluff of art as a law unto itself. (Would Burden have lain there until he died? \u201cProbably not,\u201d he said.) I have in mind Robert Rauschenberg\u2019s famous intention \u201cto act in the gap between\u201d art and life. There isn\u2019t any gap. Art is notional.

This animal was not eaten and therefore its death served no purpose not even the so called circle of life.  This was not art.  Even if his intent was to show the suffering of street animals, the life cycle, or even starvation and suffering as a whole there are many forms out there not involving cruelty.  People are devastated by the deaths of innocent lives but what makes this so horrific is that the fucking animal was captured, chained, and starved.  If this were to happen involving a human it would make headlines everywhere.  You know that thing called torture that seems to get people very riled up?  There is no reason on this earth that makes this ok.  Dont kid yourself.  People are pathetic but to judge everyone on here as someone who would throw a shoe at a stray animal is naive.
