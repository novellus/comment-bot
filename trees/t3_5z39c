How much lighting do you have over the tank as it stands? What kind of substrate is in there? Are you willing to pay for more lighting if needed, and are you willing to pull out the substrate if its not the right type for the low growing grassy stuff.\r\n\r\nThe low growing stuff actually tends to require higher lighting because its relatively 'deep' in the tank and doesn't grow very tall. So you need to have a pretty solid amount of light hitting the top of the tank so it reaches the bottom, and keeps the stuff green. If you dont have enough, it'll tend to grow stringy and brown. So figure on about 3 watts per gallon to hit the bottom of the tank nicely.\r\n\r\nThen you want to make sure you have about 1mm substrate, of a decent type so that the grass has something to grow in , and pull nutrients from. Flourite, or laterite are decent, and about the right size. Eco-complete is something that sold around here that also would work well.\r\n\r\nThe plant that everyone gets for the super green, golf course look is 'Glossostigma'. Seen [here](http://www.azgardens.com/images/AAGNurserypicGlosso.jpg). This comes in little balls about the size of a golfball, and you break it apart and plant it in little pieces, and it fills in. The more you get at once time, the less you have to wait for it to fill in the gaps.\r\n\r\nIf you wanted to use some middle height stuff also you could try some Narrow-Leaf Dwarf Subulata. [Here](http://www.azgardens.com/images/9root5.jpg) to give your aquascape some height. \r\n\r\nBoth of those will need more light than things that grow taller, and a decent substrate to grow on and pull from. CO2 injection would also make them really nice.\r\n\r\nJust to let you know, it definitely can be done, but its not usually what people getting right into the hobby go with, since the demands are a bit higher. Its well within the realm of possibility though for not a gigantic sum of money.\r\n\r\nOf course, I say that having dropped easily 5 figures on my tanks over the time I've owned them :) Everyone's got a different idea of 'expensive' and its usually inversely proportional to your enthusiasm for the given hobby you're about to spend on. :)\r\n\r\n250 liters is 66gallons roughly, so figure on about 175-200w of lighting. That should run you about..oh...$200 all said and done once you get the ballast, reflectors, and bulbs. Then build yourself a little hood, if you don't have one. That shouldnt be more than 25$ in materials. Then you need some substrate...that runs about $1 per pound usually, and is sold around here in 15 pound bags. You'll probably need about 4-5 bags to get the right depth. So figure 75$ for that. Oh and, its gonna make a KILLER mess when you put it in. YOu'll want to pull the fish out to a small 10g tank or something on the side for a day or two while the dust settles. Don't bother trying to rinse the substrate...trust me. \r\n\r\nJust remove fish, drain 99% of the water (pro-tip: keep it in buckets to reuse, you'll have less of a cycle then since you get a jumpstart on bacterial growth from whats in the water column), scoop out existing substrate, dump in new stuff, plant plants, replace water. Run the filter for a day or two, it'll settle down. Then you can reintroduce the fish.\r\n\r\nCO2 which is getting into playing with the more high tech setups can run you a little or a lot. I'd recommend going ahead and paying for a real rig. People do the thing with the yeast and the 2 liter soda bottles and stuff. It works...kinda. But it makes an awful mess and you cant really control it well.\r\n\r\nA 5lb bottle, plus a regulator, and a diffuser will run you about $450. Once you have it setup though, that 5 lb bottle should last you the better part of a year, and around here its like $12 to get refilled.\r\n\r\nIf you do decide to go co2, yo want to bubble in about 1 bubble per second, but it varies based on the tanks needs. Don't bubble too much...it lowers pH big time and can cause you trouble. Also, for the $450 you should have a solenoid on the thing. Get an electrical socket timer, and plug it in. Have it turn on with the lighting. Its pointless to pump in co2 when the lights arent on.\r\n\r\nSo there you go. For roughly a grand, you can setup a tank that will rival mine. Plus, once you figure in the fact that the dollar sucks ass right now, its probably even cheaper for you :)\r\n\r\nGood luck.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "name": "t1_c02bcib", "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5z39c", "retrieved_on": 1427425364, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02bcib", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "parent_id": "t1_c02bax9", "body": "Thanks for that, really useful info.

Even before you get that CO2 reactor for christmas. An extremely large percentage of problems in fishtanks arise from water conditions in the tank. If you can eliminate the nutrient inputs from your tap (some water has a surprising number of nitrates, phosphates or other nogoodnicks in it) then you are off to a far better start. As you replace evap, if your water has these things in it, you're just dumping more of them into the tank, probably making whatever problem you have worse, or at the very least, no better.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't have to be a whole lot of gallons per day. Get a 45g trashcan, get a small rodi from someplace like [air water ice](http://airwaterice.com), and fill it up over the course of a day or two. You're only gonna need it every now and then, so just pop a lid on it, and be done.\r\n\r\n2) Stay away from chemical addatives. This goes for fertilizers, algae killers, and anti biotics. These things MAY work, but 99% of them are snake oil. The ones that arent take very careful use, or they start to cause their own problems. Most problems in a tank are caused by an excess of nutrients. Dumping all kinds of checmicals in the tank to kill algae growth isnt really addressing the root cause, excess nutrients in the water. You're just masking it and screwing around with who knows what processes in the tank. Bad idea. Stay away. Fix the root problem.\r\nWhich leads me to the mother of all pro tips...\r\n\r\n3) FEED LESS. Ok, I know that your little guys look really hungry. I know they swim to the top of the tank when you walk by and basically just beg for food. I also know that when you put food in, they go apeshit over it and its all gone in like 4.3 seconds flat. And the fish food bottle says make sure you only feed what can be eaten in a few minutes. And so if they ate all that in 4.3 seconds, clearly, the need more! It should take 'a few minutes' for them to eat all the food! ha ha!\r\n\r\nNO. You are a bad person if you continue to feed your tank. Seriously.\r\n\r\nListen, fish live in a nutrient scarce world. At MOST in my tanks, I feed twice a week with TINY amounts. When they say a 'pinch' of food, they mean a pinch. Not a grab-as-much-as-possible-between-two-fingers. A pinch.\r\n\r\nWhen you are adding food, you are basically adding nutrients to the tank. Since the tank is generally a closed system, if you keep adding nutrients, sooner or later, you end up with an excess of something. At which point, the tank goes way down hill (algae, diseases, whatever). If you add less, you run into these problems far less. Then combine the adding less with the periodic water change (not strictly necessary, but excellent insurance), and plant growth removal (definitely necessary, this is your primary means of removing nutrients from the tank, don't let the plants grow insane and then rot in the tank, its a CLOSED SYSTEM) and you are good to go.\r\n\r\n4) Some other minor tips... Under gravel filters suck ass. Ignore them. A single fluval canister filter is fine. Clean your canister filter out on a regular schedule (usually every two months). If you don't you will regret it. Not because it'll kill your tank, but because there's nothing like having to rinse 6 months of fish shit down your tub drain. Change your bulbs every 6-9 months. Don't skimp on this. The lighting spectrum changes, and it becomes easeier as time goes on for algae to use the light than your plants.  You don't need to vacuum your gravel. Fish poop = plant happiness. Leave it be.\r\n\r\n5) Ok, final big tip here: LESS FISH. The old rule of thumb used to be 1\" of fish per gallon. That kinda sorta holds, but really, err on the side of less fish. Also, consider your biotope. Don't stick goldfish in a tropical tank. Goldfish (crazy shitting carp in the original chinese) like it cold. Don't put cichlids in with more peaceful fish. Etc etc. I mean basically, pick a type of tank you want, and stick to it. I know that other fish over there looks neat, and is pretty expensive and so wouldnt that be awesome! But, its just trouble down the line (trouble and money).\r\n\r\nOk thats all for now, until I get another break at work at least :) If you guys want to pick my brains about this stuff, please feel free to drop me a line.

These are the kits I use.\r\n\r\nSo start with the biggest tank you can manage. Personally, I wouldn't start with anything less than  75 as a total rank beginner.

Then about 100$ for the tank, and then it's best to get the special gravel, 60$ worth of gravel should do it. The plants can be had for a few bucks each, and they usually reproduce like mad, so you can start off with fewer if money is an issue.\n\nMy problem is I'm too lazy to trim the plants, and they end up overgrowing the tank, and shadowing everything out on the bottom. Careful selection of plants is a must if you want low maintenance. While fast growing plants will fill out the tank quickly, they'll be a pain in the butt later. The grass like plants on the bottom are excellent, as they don't get tall, and don't need to be trimmed.", "author": "sparkysko", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "archived": true, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "name": "t1_c02baop", "parent_id": "t3_5z39c", "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02baop"}
