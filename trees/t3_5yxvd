Specifically, the voters were able to put in place truly democratic parliamentarian govts in the states, which then started taxing the rich and giving ordinary people bankruptcy protection. This democratic trend did not sit well with the FounDing Fathers. IN fact, Elbridge Gerry called it an \"excess of democracy.\" James madison, the Father of the Constitution, said that democracy was not right for america. So Madison, et al put in place the checks and balances, which along with other undemocratic constitutional items, protected the \"minority of the opulent against the majority,\" to quote madison. madison said that the Constitution with its checks and balances would factionalize the voters and prevent them from uniting and discovering their common interest and would prevent innovation in government.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the 20th century, western europe citizens had pretty much eliminated the checks and balances that the aristocrats had used to cripple the voters over there. As a result the western europeans now have a great deal of control over their own nations through the use of PARLIAMENTARIAN government, where there is little in the way of checks and balances. \r\n\r\nThe western europeans have progressive taxation, universal healthcare, are not controlled by the military industrial complex, and have been able to start reversing the flood of 3rd world immigration and globalization that the elite have institued there as well as here.\r\n\r\nWhy do they have this and we do not?
