Do you realize how impossible it would be to pull off an inside job of that magnitude without someone blowing their cover?\n\nNow before you get all fucking gungho on me again, understand that I am not satisfied with the government's explanation of what happened. No official, professional investigation of 9/11 ever happened, the idea that the hijackers' passports were found at ground zero is utterly ridiculous, and what's more is that there is absolutely no way that our Air Force could not have responded to 4 simultaneously hijacked airplanes, especially knowing that one had already hit a building.\n\nBut to seriously sit here and say that our government orchestrated this willingly and deliberately is too complex to be possible, that's the stuff of Hollywood. There was early CIA intelligence indicating that terrorist organizations were planning to attack the WTC. What should worry you most is that your government did nothing in response. What should worry you is that the Air Force stood down on FOUR SIMULTANEOUSLY HIJACKED AIRPLANES. What should worry you is that the government allowed this to happen and used it as a pretext to start a conquest in the Middle East which is clearly fueled by oil - hence the reason we choose to attack Iraq and Iran but not Saudi Arabia. It has nothing to do with humanity or liberation, it's all about money.\n\nBut please, I've watched all the documentaries out there, Zeitgeist, Loose Change, you name it. There is absolutely no concrete way to affirm their conclusions beyond what is obvious - the Air Force DID stand down while three airplanes, nearly four, flew into two private structures and one governmental structure.\n\nThat is the issue here, not this tin foil hat bullshit about our government doing this on its own, it's way too elaborate and way too easy to oust as an inside job.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "politics", "ups": 3, "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5z5cp", "retrieved_on": 1427425323, "body": "you distrust the official story but find the idea of an inside job ridiculous? uh huh. there's plenty of research done on the subject by independent sources academic and otherwise, a trip to you tube should enlighten you. for a tragedy of such a magnitude, official evidence sure was disposed of quickly, the holes are still there for political props, the perpetrator is unknown, it certainly isn't bin missing, and one building fell down 'all on its own'..for being skeptic about the official version, you've surely dismissed the unofficial ones as well.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more tragic than to find an individual bogged down in the length of life, devoid of breadth. -- Martin Luther King, Jr.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "name": "t1_c02bfqs", "parent_id": "t1_c02bfek", "id": "c02bfqs", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "politics", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 0, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5z5cp", "retrieved_on": 1427425326, "id": "c02bfek", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "name": "t1_c02bfek", "parent_id": "t3_5z5cp", "body": " While I have no trust or respect for the official story behind 9/11, it is unfounded to call the thing an inside job.
