I completely agree with you on not being afraid of crime outside of school in the 60s and 70s. For me, the funny thing about that was I learned to shoot a rifle at my school and guns in school did not have the same connotation as today. In fact, from about age 8 on, I, and many of the boys I knew carried a pocketknife at all times. Yet, gun or knife violence was unheard of.\n\nConsider this, though, how many people you knew then had house or car alarms, much less lived in gated communities?

Virtually everyone I knew was touched by violent crime in the 80s, including me. Since 89 or 90, I don't know a single victim of violent crime. In the 60s and 70s I was kid and I can say I was never afraid of violent crime outside of school. In school I was terrified of it for good reason. So terrified it ruined my school experience. There was a group that was constantly trying to hurt me and I had to use most of my energy trying to deal with them.\n\nBut economically the 70s were no picnic. I think there were 3 or 4 recessions, high unemployment. \n\nThe 60s were better. I think the time people really wax nostalgically about was from 60-63. I think those were great times if you lived in a big city like New York, Chicago, or L.A. Housing was cheap, jobs were plentiful, especially if you had a degree.

However, as that chart you linked shows, there was a very significant change in how violent crime data was reported in 1993. There's a lot of controversy over that and what it really means. Did violent crime go down? Or were things just adjusted to make it look that way? (Yes, I know what DOJ has to say about that.)\n\nAll I can go on is personal experience. Throughout the 60s and 70s, I only knew one guy that was personally touched by violent crime. The number of people that I personally know, including me, who have been affected by violent crime in the 90s and 2000's is literally dozens. In fact, amongst 20 some odd immediate coworkers, it's almost hard to come up with anybody who has not been assaulted, mugged, burglarized, raped, car jacked, or had a kid or house terrorized by gangbangers. The consequences of the war on drugs have made for an out of control situation. \n\nDon't take my word for it, though.

By the '60s and '70s, most of the material *needs* mentioned in that article were being met for most of the middle class. Access to cheap energy, water and healthcare were all much improved from the '40s and '50s. Luxury goods were still luxuries, but a single low median income could provide for a family of four without undue hardship. Jobs tended to be longterm affairs where quite frequently the company offered generous vacations and retirement packages.\n\nBut more to the point, across America, communities were still actual communities where people knew and regularly interacted with each other. In many communities crime was virtually unheard of. There were no car jackings. Gang violence referred to fistfights between tough kids, not drive by shootings and political factions. There was no HIV. No war on terror. No war on Drugs. No worries over mass immigration or job outsourcing. There were no worries over Peak Oil, Global Climate Change or the rapid erosion of civil liberties. \n\nThis is not to say that the '60s and '70s were a trouble free Utopia. We had the Cold War, the Vietnam War, Watergate, the Middle East crisis, the oil embargo and subsequent rationing, etc. But, with the exception of the underlying concerns over nuclear war and mutually assured destruction, the problems all seemed so much more manageable than today. Not as much was so completely out of control. Greed was not the prevalent motivation for every act and policy. Sex was not quite as in our faces 24/7. Hell, religion wasn't even as in-your-face as it is today. ", "author_flair_css_class": null}
