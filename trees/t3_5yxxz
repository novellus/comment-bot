You should start with Big &amp; Rich. Country but with more of the kind of background you are already familiar with. Move on to Clutch's in-fucking-credible 2007 album \"From Beale Street To Oblivion\". That's the rocking southern blues sound done right (Electric Worry is a perfect-10 southern rocking song). The Red House Painter's rather sombre \"Songs For A Blue Guitar\" is also a bit country-ish, but more in the folksy/weepy blues direction.\n\nBy the way, these albums expect to have your full attention. If you're doing something other than sitting there with your eyes closed and wearing a pair of headphones, you'll probably miss something (or everything). Casual listening is for AFTER you've already given it your full attention at least once.\n\nNow, before continuing, get Ray Charles - Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music. Unquestionably one of the best albums of all time. Since it mixes country with a lot of styles it's another great one to ease your way into the classics. You might also try Johnny Cash's discography in reverse chronological order.\n\nAlso do not overlook Elvis Presley. All the troubadour bullshit aside he is one damn fine musical artist. Find his '68 comeback special DVD (there are torrents) if you want to get a look at the real musician when he's not being forced to go on parade by his record and movie contracts.\n\nThen try some classic country, like anything by Roger Miller (he's the best by far - King of the Road), Hank Williams, John Prine, Conway Twitty, etc. Move up a bit into David Allen Coe, Alabama, Oak Ridge Boys, Ozark Mountain Daredevils. If you like Folk-style, Willie Nelson is one of the best of all time, and some of Bruce Springsteen's later works aren't bad either. Creedence Clearwater Revival has more than a few country songs in there as well.\n\nMove on to modern country by dabbling a bit with Dwight Yoakam, Vince Gill, George Strait, Garth Brooks, Randy Travis, Alan Jackson, etc.\n\nIt'll take you a bit to hone in on the kind of country you like. It also grows on you with time. The old joke goes that if you play a country song backwards, the man gets back his truck, his job, his wife/girlfriend, and gets out of jail. Sadly that's not too far from the truth with most country songs. The good ones are always the ones that don't try to be country. It's not all 'hick/redneck music' by any means.\n\nSome general tips - the best music you never like right away. You're already well ahead of most people since you are actually trying to broaden your tastes. Good for you, NEVER stop doing that. When you find a genre, don't stop until you find something in it that speaks to you directly. There are no bad genres, only ones you haven't learned to appreciate yet.\n\nThe best albums require some EFFORT to understand. Mike Oldfield's album \"Amarok\" (yes, the music player is named after it) is the finest example of this I know (and Kayo Dot's incomprehensible \"Dowsing Anemone With Copper Tongue\" is a close second). Also, nothing is ever OLD until you yourself have heard it. Old is relative, not chronological.\n\nHave a blast, there's more good music out there than anyone can listen to in a dozen lifetimes. I keep meaning to cook up a torrent with a DVD's worth representing the best and most diverse of all genres, but it's taking me a loooong time to make sure the album selections truly count. ;) I'm also trying to make it post-2000 released to dispel the ridiculous notion that there's no good modern music. We're at the beginning of an unprecedented renaissance of music. Enjoy it! \n\nedit - somehow I left out Gordon Lightfoot, \"Summertime Dream\" and \"Sundown\" are both great.
