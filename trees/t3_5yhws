Like the article says he has had the most success of any manager of the yankees. He is also more respected by his players than probably any other manager in baseball, and this is very important. If you look at the problems the yankees have had over the last few seasons, they have not been managerial, they have been with pitching. It finally looks like they have more than a few outstanding young studs. They should keep moose in the pen, resign mo, get rid of clemens, and pick up one quality starter in the off season. Those moves, combined with the good young talent they already have, will make there pitching very good and reliable.", "author": "marm0lade", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "id": "c029sc8", "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qgzy", "name": "t1_c029sc8", "parent_id": "t3_5yhws", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}
