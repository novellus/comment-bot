He works on a ship, which I shall leave unnamed, that is part of the prepositioning program (http://www.msc.navy.mil/PM3/).  Needless to say, he was on his way east before any official war cries from the administration.  Because is ship is docked when not active, they get 90 days notice from when they will be deployed, although the specifics about where they will be deployed to aren't always given upfront.  Needless to say, military planners know far before any public action what they are going to do.\n\nI would not be at all surprised if he got another 90 day notice soon.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
