Here are some possibilities:\n\n* posting links to pages they control, but disguised by using [tinyurl](http://tinyurl.com) or the like. \n\n* posting pages at a rate that exceeds the rate at which a human could discover interesting pages.\n\n* regularly posting links to stolen content, such as link jacked or framed pages.\n\n* regularly posting links to blog entries which trivially wrap a link to real content.\n\n* posting duplicate links.\n\n* reposting previously posted links.\n\n* posting links which have been submitted to other sites, especially when it looks like link harvesting.\n\n* posting in the wrong subreddit, e.g. political stories outside of [politics.reddit.com](http://politics.reddit.com), or any Hollywood starlet story outside of [entertainment.reddit.com](http://entertainment.reddit.com)\n\n* foreign language posts to the wrong subreddit, e.g. german language posts not in [de.reddit.com](http://de.reddit.com)\n\n* posting links to pages with embedded YouTube videos, instead of linking directly to YouTube.\n\nI am sure there are many other posting behaviors that annoy the community.
