Most faithful people are decent folk, not nasty neo-cons. You don't need to go to any church to believe in the power of prayer, for instance. So my idea is to gather as many people as I can on the State House lawn who believe in prayer, great guerilla theater, or a combination of the two. We'd get the media there to observe a whole bunch of citizens praying that Bush &amp; Cheney, Inc. go away. Nothing harsh, we'd just inform the press that we're asking the great what-ever to do something about our little problem. (God's choice, if you will.) Don't you think the Neo's would go balistic when all of those \"liberals\" stole their psychological god-weapon? And what could the authorities do to stop a bunch of citizens praying peacefully? Nothing, that's what. I'm considering calling the event a \"Pray-Down\".

Father, help us to never forsake our prayers for our President, for You use our petitions to perform mighty works in his life. You have chosen him for the purpose of leading a nation---indeed, the world; and You are using his example to witness to people across the globe. Father, we acknowledge our hurt and anger toward those who continuously denounce him, second-guess him, underestimate him, deride his faith, and lie about his intentions. O Lord, we know that the devil never seems to have to look very far for people who are willing to do his work. Hear our cries for our President, Lord. Father, defend Your servant, George W. Bush. Help him to find favor with the American people and restore their support for his leadership. Please help him to continue to do what is right and just, for this is more acceptable to You than sacrifice. For Your Name\u2019s sake, O Lord, preserve his life; in Your righeouseness, bring him out of every trouble. In Your unfailing love, we pray that You would silence the enemies of freedom and liberty.  Heal us, Father. Raise up for us prayer warriors who will stand in the gap for our beloved America. We are confident that You are able to answer these prayers in mighty and awesome ways.
