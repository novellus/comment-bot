Today I saw a new message that came in that urged people to canvass a republican part of town and get people to register to vote.\n\nI don't think helping to get out the vote in these areas will help liberals in the long run, if Ron Paul doesn't get the republican nomination. People will register to vote, register republican, get involved, and then choose the lesser of two evils in their opinion, which will probably be republicans who will continue the mess we have now.\n\nHaving lots of people vote doesn't help a democracy. Having lots of informed people vote does. Republicans certainly don't help democrats to get out and vote.
