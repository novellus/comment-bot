The point where the pitching moment is zero is called the center of lift and it is usually near the trailing edge of the wing, though it can be behind it. At the center of lift the moments of the stronger (and closer) upward lift on top of the wing and the weaker (and further away) downforce cancel. It would be a perfect place for the CG but. . .\n\nit would yield negative static stability. Imagine a weather vane with the axis of rotation at the trailing edge! The trick of the airplane is to get the pitching moment to equal zero at a point further forward on the wing chord so we can put our axis of rotation (the CG) at that point. It just so happens that a small amount of downward lift placed way behind the main wing will move the total center of pressure forward by canceling much of the nasty down-pitching moment of the wing. We put our CG at that point and call it a day.\n\nI should note that depending on the airfoil of the main wing and the location of the CG the tail does not necessarily have to produce a downward force to have positive static stability. However, most airplanes are designed so the tail creates downward lift in equilibrium conditions and the airfoil on the tail is cambered downward.\n\nAnd to answer your question - the benefits of stabilization are that the airplane flies without computers making control surface inputs 20+ times per second.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c029vbx", "id": "c029vy6", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "ups": 1, "name": "t1_c029vbx", "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5yhl0", "retrieved_on": 1427426124, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c029vbx", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c029s0g", "body": "I don't understand the benefits of stabilizer benefits as you've described, so I'll take your word for it.
