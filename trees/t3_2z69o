I'd love it if the author understood the term \"Focus\"\n\n9) If she trash-talks me, it's go time. Any girl who can give but can't take it isn't worth  your time.\n\n8) Conceded. I agree.\n\n7) Any guy that gets mad at his girl for \"not using the fancy gernades\" doesn't deserve a girlfriend in the first-place. I agree\n\n6) She's not stupid. She knows why she's getting these friend requests. Besides, letting her talk is only going to get her \"Can you post your boobies online?\" comments. Somehow I doubt she'd appreciate that.\n\n5) \"Sorry sweetie, Its just part of the game\" is a sure-fire way to get a kick to the nuts. \n\n4) Girls generally aren't bad at video games, they just don't like playing them. She'll suck at first, yeah, but she'll also beat you down after ten minutes. Girls aren't as stupid as gamers think they are.\n\n3) Once again: Girls aren't as stupid as gamers think they are. She'll know your using her as a shield.\n\n2) Because the point of getting your girlfriend to play Halo is to make her feel like a damsel in distress? Who wrote this again?\n\n1) If I have to concede everything I do, it won't be fun, it'll be annoying and frustrating. It'll be like playing with a 5 year old. If she doesn't like video games, trying to make her play won't mean she's trying with all she's got.
