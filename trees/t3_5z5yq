Look at the character  Autolycus in William Shakespeare's play *The Winter's Tale*. He exemplifies Blake's adage by acting like a crippled and stumbling blind man, so that when some naieve passer-by on the road comes to his aid, he can rob the sucker blind and thank the fool profusely for his kindness. \r\n\r\nIt's dangerous to assume that the simplest, or most adequate, explanation is always going to be the right one.

After 9/11 people stopped questioning the government, put on their flag lapel pins and danced to the tune of the neocons. \n\nYou remember the huge spurts of outrage after it was confirmed that there were no WMDs? You remember the massive protests, general strikes and immediate impeachment proceedings?\n\nOh that's right; that never happened. I'm sure Rudy Guiliani could tell you the reason: 9/11! 9/11! 9/11!\n\nThe interesting thing in my mind is that (because of the neocons' grip on the MSM) many people believe that we did actually find WMDs, and that Saddam was involved the whole time. In fact, hardly anybody seems to believe that Osama planned the operation. You've got people believing Saddam did it on the hard right and truthers on the hard left and libertarian right. The only people who believe the official story are middle of the road liberals and moderates who probably voted for Bill and will vote for Hillary because they're too stupid to realize she's a neocon in sheeps' clothing. \n\nBesides, this was never really about WMDs, was it? That was just the excuse (of many) that gained the most traction. The idea that the Bush admin really wanted to sell was that al Qaeda had helpfully popped up in Iraq. Al Qaeda is the key -- since they are a CIA-backed organization you can expect them to show up in every country that Bush wants to invade. I'm surprised they haven't been \"found\" in Iran yet. But like I said, the Al Qaeda story didn't gain as much traction as the WMD story, so we can expect the main reason for invading Iran to be their pursuit of nuclear weapons. Of course, once we invade we'll find they were years away from a bomb, but by then it will be late. Iraq redux. \n\nPeople seem to forget that Bush's imperial adventures are entirely dependent on the 9/11 myth. If there was no 9/11 there is no invasion of Iraq or Afghanistan. Everything flows from 9/11; that's why I believe it deserves a second look.... oh and not by the CIA for fuck's sake.

Because it's a very long process of engagement, in which those that feel that something is wrong can participate in. The motivating factor of the truth movement is as much that they have been actively locked out of participation as that they want to reveal what they believe has been withheld.\n\nUnlike previous eras you are not going to be able to effectively create a reinforcing imposed consensus after the fact. This was possible during the 9-11 commission hearing, had they been done well, but given the giant fall in credibility of the commission, Kane for example endorsing ABC/Disney's very political Path to 911 mini-series, a whole new commission is needed.\n\nBasically taking the Maher/Clinton approach is fighting a network effect.
