In the winter it would be damn near impossible I live at the top of a very steep hill and with 2 feet of snow that would be a pretty big challenge.\n\nSome would say move closer to work or work from home but that instantly make this \"simple\" change a very complex one.\n\n&gt;Simple Way #4 - Choose Electric Hand Dryers over Paper Towels\n\nSeems to me this is just trading one evil for another. Electric dryers are extremely inefficient, most of them don't even dry your hands in the first shot and I'd wager they waste more than paper towels. At least with the paper towels you have some assurance that the trees used to make them were grown for that purpose.\n\nOther than that I think there are some really great ideas there.
