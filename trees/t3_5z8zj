Although the Spanish Inquisition is perhaps the most famous, it was an institution common to the Catholic world. To my knowledge, the Catholic Church has never apologized for the crimes of the Inquisition. \n\nOne of the most famous victims of the Inquisition, although he was not tortured, but forced to recant his statements about the motion of the planets and imprisoned in his house for life, was Galileo Galilei. It is interesting to note that the current Pope, in his previous position as Prefect of the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith, has stated: \"In Galileo's time, the Church was much more faithful to reason than Galileo himself. Galileo's trial was reasonable and just.\"", "subreddit": "politics", "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_5z8zj", "name": "t1_c02bo75", "author_flair_css_class": null}
