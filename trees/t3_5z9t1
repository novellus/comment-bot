People in the Administration love the series, too...\"\n\nMore from the *New Yorker*: 'The third expert at the meeting was Tony Lagouranis, a former Army interrogator in the war in Iraq. He told the show\u2019s staff that DVDs of shows such as \u201c24\u201d circulate widely among soldiers stationed in Iraq. Lagouranis said to me, \u201cPeople watch the shows, and then walk into the interrogation booths and do the same things they\u2019ve just seen.\u201d He recalled that some men he had worked with in Iraq watched a television program in which a suspect was forced to hear tortured screams from a neighboring cell; the men later tried to persuade their Iraqi translator to act the part of a torture \u201cvictim,\u201d in a similar intimidation ploy. Lagouranis intervened: such scenarios constitute psychological torture.' ...\n\n'Lagouranis told the \u201c24\u201d team what the U.S. military and the F.B.I. teach real intelligence professionals: \u201crapport-building,\u201d the slow process of winning over informants, is the method that generally works best. There are also nonviolent ruses, he explained, and ways to take suspects by surprise. The \u201c24\u201d staff seemed interested in the narrative possibilities of such techniques; Lagouranis recalled, \u201cThey told us that they\u2019d love to incorporate ruses and rapport-building.\u201d At the same time, he said, Cochran and the others from \u201c24\u201d worried that such approaches would \u201ctake too much time\u201d on an hour-long television show.'\n\nEdit: 2008 presidential candidates who are fans of *24* include [John McCain](http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/10/11/406947.aspx) and [Tom Tancredo](http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=55722).
