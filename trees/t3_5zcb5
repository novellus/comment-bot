If that\u2019s not what happened then all of his years on committees, all of the meetings he allegedly attended, all of the briefings he supposedly read were for nothing; useless, nothing but resume fodder. Either he chose to deliberately mislead people again this month or he\u2019s completely ignorant about the war which he seeks to command.", "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5zcb5", "name": "t1_c02bxj9", "author_flair_css_class": null}
