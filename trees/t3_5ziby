And when my tainted spirit finds its destination, I will topple the master of that dark place. From my black throne, I will lash together a machine of bone and blood, and fueled by my hatred for you this fear engine will bore a hole between this world and that one. When it begins, you will hear the sound of children screaming - as though from a great distance. A smoking orb of nothing will grow above your bed, and from it will emerge a thousand starving crows. As I slip through the widening maw in my new form, you will catch only a glimpse of my radiance before you are incinerated. Then, as tears of bubbling pitch stream down my face, my dark work will begin. I will open one of my six mouths, and I will sing the song that ends the Earth.", "author": "Hate", "created_utc": "1193836703", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c02ccpr", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5ziby", "name": "t1_c02ccpr", "author_flair_css_class": null}
