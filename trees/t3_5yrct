I believe they corrected the single player suckage in the third iteration, but the theme was still the same; apparently awesome game, if you're playing multiplayer, so thats a 10 out of 10 then.", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "gaming", "name": "t1_c02ahp8", "parent_id": "t1_c02adbd", "ups": 1, "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "gaming", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 1, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5yrct", "retrieved_on": 1427425891, "id": "c02adbd", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02adbd", "parent_id": "t3_5yrct", "body": "I don't trust gamespot as far as I can throw it.
