I would love to see a source on that one.  The only I have heard there is sleep deprivation and loud music.\n\nAbu Gharib?  That was an isolated incident and only the \"bush is hitler\" nutjobs think the administration had a direct hand in it.\n\nRenditioning?  I hate to break it to you but enemy forces fighting on a field of battle *out of uniform* have no rights under Geneva. None, zip, nada.  Call it wrong all you like, but illegal its not.\n\nFISA?   This has been done in drug enforcement long before WOT.  And there is no spying on 'millions' of citizens either.\n\nThe roving wiretaps are on *individuals* which we are trying to monitor, therefore law enforcement should be able to track them on new phones. If you think terrorists under surveillance should be able to just grab a new cell phone at Wal-mart and start the whole judicial review process all over again you are crazy. \n", "author": "DavidM01", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c0299ce", "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": "t1_c2zxpw", "name": "t1_c0299ce", "author_flair_css_class": null}
