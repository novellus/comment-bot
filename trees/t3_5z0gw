By amputating sexual organs, it is hoped the victim will forgo sexual activities as an adult because they do not have the organs to feel pleasure from sexual intercourse. \n\nWhy not get it: It's cruel, inhuman, tortures the victim, leaves permanent physical and psychological scars, is a violation of their internationally-acknowledged human right to a whole body, and many, many more. Genital mutilation has been linked to increased violence, anti-social behavior, low-self-esteem, and depression in men. \n\nWhat to do instead: Relax and stop demonizing sexuality. Find a good therapist. Leave your child alone. Respect their human right to a whole body.", "author": "kanuk876", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "gilded": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "science", "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_5z0gw", "id": "c02b5ep", "author_flair_css_class": null}
