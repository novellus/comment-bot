However, the rest is quite neglectful, failing to describe many other less \"sexy-sounding\" methods that are also good for global optimization and involve stochasticity. GAs have no monopoly on any of the \"good features\" touted by this article, and (I believe) are much harder to analyze mathematically to do useful things like prove bounds and so forth. I've never seen any reason to believe that GAs have any inherent superiority over any other stochastic global optimization algorithm.\n\nGAs have been successful at various applications, but given that optimization is such a parameter-dependent thing, I always feel that some of the head to head comparisons are a bit suspect -- you can tweak the hell out of a GA and have it outpreform some off the shelf optimizer, but does that really tell you much?\n\nUndoubtedly, there are certain problems that are really well-suited to GAs -- ones with solutions where a partial solution is a good start to the global optima, and where elements of the solution are relatively independent (e.g. good candidates for evolution and recombination). Too bad this article didn't even mention that, or mention that in particularly spiky optimization landscapes, GAs may be totally inappropriate.\n\nGAs are a tool. Tools are cool, but it makes no sense to see an article like this, which (pardon the analogy) would be something like an article saying how much better drills are than hammers. There are just different tools for different jobs.
