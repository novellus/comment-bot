It started when many of my friends started using AOL Instant Messenger (AIM). I was suckered into believing that signing up for a free AIM screenname wouldn't cause me any problems. Boy was I wrong.\n\nI used the AIM screenname on and off for a couple years without incident. Then AOL introduced something called AIM Phoneline. It is basically a phone number they give you attached to an AIM account. You can receive calls with it on your computer. I signed up for it and used the phone number to give out to places I really didn't want to have my real phone number, but still might need to occasionally get a call from. If someone called the number, it simply went to voicemail. I could then listen to the voicemail online and return the call as necessary. All in all it was a pretty handy service and began to change the way I thought about AOL.\n\nThis past July I needed to make an outbound call from that number (long story). I hooked up a headset to my computer and proceeded to dial. The AIM software told me I needed to have a premium account to place outbound calls, so I reluctantly signed up for one after seeing they had a thirty-day free trial. Ignoring my better judgment, I gave AOL my credit card number thinking I would cancel before the thirty day trial period was over...\"", "author_flair_css_class": null}
