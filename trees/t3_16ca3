Most people aren't driving to work thinking \"oh those poor animals I have to save them.\" They're eating a McGriddle and wiping their greasy fingers. In business it's not about what's right and wrong it's about what you can and cant do to make money. If PETA wants to make a change they're going to have to come up with a kickass advertising campaign that says \"Happy Meat Tastes Good.\" A cow stands in a lush green pasture in the warm sun and chomps grass. It's gorgeous outside there's rainbows and shit, the cow's smiling and then BAM! Didn't see that coming.  Double quarter pounder with cheese 100% delicious happiness.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
