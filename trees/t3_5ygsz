That was back in 1966, before the advent of the huge corporations that now own everything. Back then, you worked 20 to 50 years for the same firm. Loyalty truly was a two-way street. Nowdays, my son is lucky to be at the same job two years in a row. Should he be loyal to some company who will let him go as soon as their accountant says it would save money? Hell no! \r\n I had a career in product design. At first, I would be at the same place for years. That all began to change in the \"greed is good\" 80's. By the end, I was contracting myself out to different firms on the short term. This had many benefits. Besides often getting paid more than some company person you wound up sitting next to, the boss/employee dynamic was always in my favor because I was treated more like a guest than an employee. This is because it was true. I was my own agent, and not one of theirs. I felt sorry for some of these poor, loyal  fools, quaking at some fat bullies command. At one place, they started random pee testing of their employees. I told the ass-hat in charge of this little pogrom that he could test anyone he felt like, except for me. He had a fit but was powerless. Boy, did that ever feel good! And this was the best power of all, because if a boss did turn out to be an abusive asshole, I could just say \"See you later, shithead!\" and find a decent job the next day. In short, unless you have your own sweat and money invested in your work, loyalty is misplaced.
