We had a farm house by the countryside, a two fast lane traffic rural road right at front and about 100 feet in the back there was a narrow river.\n\nOn Sundays the whole family used to go grocery shopping. They used do this very early in the morning but many times they left me asleep for a couple of hours while they made it back home.\nOne foggy morning around 8 I woke up bothered by the day light coming through the window that was right on top of my headrest.\nWhile I was barely waking up I stood on my pillow to contemplate the early morning through the window; I started watching the cars speeding by on both sides of the freeway, there was a T exit made of a little off road which looked like a trail right on the other side of the main road.\nThere where big bushy trees all along both sides of this trail, with joined leafy branches on top which made it looked like a bushy, misty and scary cave.\nI stood by the window looking outside for like three to five minutes and that's when I saw it:\n\nAll at the sudden a saw what it seemed to be an incredible tall man, he looked like about 8 or 10 feet in hight with long dirty dreadlocks and his clothes were filthy, ripped and they seemed too small on him who came out of the bushy trees onto this trail and started walking down into this cave-like obscure trail.\nAfter watching him for like 10 seconds I was overcome by fear and my first reaction was to slam close the slightly opened window making a loud noise when doing it.\nThe silence of that early morning amplified that loud 'clang' sound like five times over, as I looked through the glass window one more time I saw with horror him looking straight at me!\nHis face was like charcoal dirty, with an over grown bear almost covering his entire face; At that very moment I rushed to hide under my bed.\nI will never know if he eventually walked over to the house or if he used to always roam the contryside in the darkness of the night.\n\nWhen my Parents finally arrived all they did was laugh at my \"home alone\" story. I know it, I saw it, was it big foot?\n\nI'll never know! \n\nMexico\n\n\n", "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5z5dt", "name": "t1_c02bfbi", "author_flair_css_class": null}
