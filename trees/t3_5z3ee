NO ONE LIKES THOSE THINGS!! Yet if you watch fox news all you here about is how awesome and justified Bush and his homies are, How BlackWater and Israel are Justified, How all those republicans and priests need the benefit of the doubt when they are clearly wrong - NO-ONE believes that except the ones weak-minded enough to fall for it... Reddit is By the Users and For the Users... with a little administrative monitoring and upkeep...
