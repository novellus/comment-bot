If they wish to be peeping toms, we'll do court. When they wish to engage in mass kidnappings, torture and imprisonment of Americans for pretend, extraconstitutional offenses, let it be said they've decided to open a most dangerous can of worms by doing so. \r\n\r\nIn a time where they need us to trust them to fight terrorists, they've responded by shredding the Constitution, building support for terrorist ideologies and eroding their support base through abuse and oppression. That support base is us. \r\n\r\nHomeland Security, take note. You're a useless agency that secures nothing and endangers us all by oppressing everything.  \r\n\r\nWhile that does not mean firing the first shot, that does mean firing many, many more and throwing these bastards back out of Lexington and Concord when they do. \r\n\r\nHint to spooks - don't ever think about shooting at, kidnapping or violating the inalienable rights of Americans ANY LONGER. Bad fucking plan. \r\n\r\nThis spying shit is conniving, and this secretive process of government is the work of fools aspiring to be tyrants. Let it be said now that no legitimate activity in a republic has cause for secrecy in these contexts. This bill is the action of cowards too afraid to oppress us, themselves, openly and in person. \r\n\r\nWe can do this the easy way by following the Constitution and bringing all of this garbage to an immediate halt, or we can do this the hard way when tyrants feel it appropriate to beat, torture and abuse people publicly in the streets. \r\n\r\nSo crackdowns on our inalienable rights will be done at the sole risk of tyrants from this point forward. The same tyrants should hope and pray they accidentally or purposefully select someone else aside from me. \r\n\r\nWe talk and function within warrants, rule of Constitutional law and due process. There's no problem with that. We have all the time in the world for that, and will cooperate with it as we always have. \r\n\r\nBut anyone wishing to knowingly abuse power, or carrying out orders to knowingly and violently abuse it risks jail time in the best circumstance and a dirt nap in the most severe. \r\n\r\nThere is a difference between being a public servant and a thief in the night. One is highly respected and rewarded for upholding the rule of law while defending the Constitution and liberty. The other takes his life in his own hands, because while gentlemen and public servants can knock, I'm not about to gamble whether intruders are here to harm myself and my family or proclaim the good news from Jehovah at 3 in the morning.\r\n\r\nAnd any spook or beauracrat calling the above \"terrorist\" statements is the real terrorist. Such a person should be tried, and instead of suffering the cruel or unusual punishment outside of justice they advocate, they should instead be afforded the chance to take their own life upon conviction. \r\n\r\nYou'll find what I've said quite legal... and more frighteningly, quite true.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world:\n\n... He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.... (((Remind you of anything Gonzales might have done?)))\n\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance. (((Homeland Security, TSA...?)))\n\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power. (((Military tribunals for civilians?)))\n\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\nFor Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\n(((Like making Blackwater immune from prosecution, or failing to prosecute police who kill civillians with tasers?)))\n\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences\n(((Extraordinary rendition; Guantanamo?)))\n\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies: (((Guantanamo, Iraq...)))\n\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\n(((Habeas Corpus, for example?)))\n \nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\n(((Declaring yourself exempt from laws passed by Congress?)))\n\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.\n(((War on this, War on that...)))\n\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\n\nHe is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &amp; perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\n(((Ummm, do I even need to go there?))) \n\nIn every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury.

Many sheeple will think that this is a good thing as the media spin will be overwhelmingly positive.\n\nWhen all the real loudmouths (patriots I say) are locked up, they'll begin perusing the \"social websites.\"  As the Stalinist-type purge continues, they will find this post.  Props to [johnathanandrew](http://reddit.com/user/johnathanandrew/), [dreale](http://reddit.com/user/dreale/), [wil2200](http://reddit.com/user/wil2200/) and all of you who had the courage to reply to this post with outrage.  For those of you think this is all BS, I will quote myself from last night:\n\n&gt;when you combine this with\n\n&gt;&gt;1. what they want to do to the Internet\n\n&gt;&gt;2. proposals to force ISP's to keep track of everything you do\n\n&gt;&gt;3. immunity for telcos for illegal spying\n\n&gt;&gt;4. each party trying to look \"tough on terrorists\"\n&gt;&gt;5. corruption and influence by corporations\n\n&gt;&gt;6. the impending destruction of the dollar and the worldwide depression to follow\n\n&gt;&gt;7. attack on Iran and the post peak oil collapse\n\n&gt;one realizes that these parasites are beginning to worry about their own asses. And just to be on the safe side, they want to have the legal justifications for the civil crackdowns which are coming next.
