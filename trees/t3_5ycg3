The same reasons that drive news coverage of all kinds. Some things are covered purely because they are novel and interesting.

So much for the \"liberal media\".\n\n&gt; Do our coverage decisions forestall the emergence of candidates who could otherwise draw enough backing to win a major party nomination or the presidency? Perhaps a little. But I doubt very much.\n\nBullshit.\n\n&gt; Plenty of candidates have overcome bad press or dismissive press, made their own breaks, and moved into full contention--think Jimmy Carter in 1976, Gary Hart in 1984, Bill Clinton in 1992, John McCain in 2000, John Kerry in 2004.\n\nThere is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about. -- Oscar Wilde.\n\nWhen you're slandering or criticizing a candidate you're informing the public about him/her.
