Running Linux is like watching the public TV network.\r\n\r\nThis will not be the case if/when Linux becomes \"mainstream\" as a desktop operating system.\r\n\r\n&gt;Security -- Last year, 48,000 new virus signatures were documented for Windows, compared to 40 for Linux. Still, most distros come with firewalls and antivirus (AV) software. Programs like Guarddog and Clam-AV are free, of course.\r\n\r\nSee above.  Also, there are easy to use, non-resource hogging, FREE a/v and firewall tools for Windows as well.\r\n\r\n&gt;Installation -- Anyone who's done it once knows that installing Windows from scratch takes hours or even days by the time you get all your apps up and running. With Linux, it can take as little as half an hour to install the operating system, utilities, and a full set of applications. No registration or activation is required, no paperwork, and no excruciating pack drill. \r\n\r\nI have yet to find a version of Linux that worked out or was easy to install \"out of the box\" for the average user, who can barely figure out how to enter formulas into an Excel spreadsheet.\r\n\r\n&gt;Keeping track of software -- Like most Windows users, I have a shelf full of software CDs and keep a little book with serial numbers under my bed in case I have to reinstall the lot. With Linux, there are no serial numbers or passwords to lose or worry about. Not a single one.\r\n\r\nIf you're still taking up a whole shelf with CD jewel boxes and not using a binder, you're an idiot.  Problem solved.  (this was mostly a joke. so simmer down.)\r\n\r\n&gt;Updating software -- Linux updates all the software on your system whenever updates are available online, including all applications programs. Microsoft does that for Windows software but you have to update each program you've added from other sources. That's about 60 on each of my PCs. More icing on the Linux cake is that it doesn't ask you to reboot after updates. XP nags you every ten minutes until you curse and reboot your machine. If you choose \"custom install\" to select only the updates you want, XP hounds you like a mangy neighborhood dog until you give in.\r\n\r\nwhat if I don't want my software updated automatically?  What if a specific version of X is the only one that works with app Y?\r\n\r\n&gt;More security -- These days, operating systems are less vulnerable than the applications that run on them. Therefore a vital aspect of PC security is keeping your apps up-to-date with the latest security patches. That's hard manual labor in Windows, but with Linux it's automatic.\r\n\r\nWhat?  Windows Update isn't manual in an out-of-the-box installation.\r\n\r\n&gt;A wealth of built-in utilities -- The utilities supplied with Windows are pretty ordinary on the whole, that's why so many small software firms have made a nice living writing better ones. Linux programs are comparable with the best Windows freeware, from CD burners to photo managers, memory monitors and disk utilities. PDF conversion is built-in, both into OpenOffice Writer and into the DTP application Scribus. All you do is click a button on the task bar. \r\n\r\nMost of which the average user will never care about or use.
