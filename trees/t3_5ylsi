There are lots of packages, but many of them are very limited to only simple line/bar charts, and a lot of them don't give very nice output. No anti-aliasing, no nice fonts, no pretty default colors. Seems like in many cases it's a lot of work to get something actually good-looking (and performant for larger datasets -- I felt this ruled out the JS-based toolkits).\n\nI looked at the Plotrs and the PlotKits and the amCharts and the FusionCharts software and several others. I looked at Cairo (decided it probably wouldn't be that easy to get a robust version of cairo and pycairo running on some of the Windows boxes we have) and Antigrain (would need aggdraw to use it from Python, couldn't get that to work on the Linux box). I finally wrote four or five separate graphics generating scripts:\n\n* One using [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/); it was alright, but I didn't like the API that much. Does have a lot of backends, though (a PDF one, an AGG one, etc). It seems organized very differently from all the other packages I got to use.\n* One using [PIL](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/). I tried to use the aggdraw package, but couldn't get it working. PIL worked alright for producing PNG images, but I decided I wanted vector graphics in the end, because they make zooming nicer.\n* One using pure SVG. This was pretty nice; generating useful SVG is not that hard. Only problem is, when you feed it a lot of elements, it gets pretty darn slow. Firefox couldn't really cope with some of my graphics . (I tried Opera as well as I'd heard its SVG performance was better, but that didn't help much.) I even tried to get a SVG-to-PDF conversion thing going using some glue code someone had released that used librsvg and Cairo, but that ran out of memory.\n* One of the nicer ones I tried was [PyX](http://pyx.sourceforge.net/). It renders to PDF or PostScript and has quite a lot of features. Only problem with it is that it requires tex or latex to render text, which I consider a hefty dependency and which hurt the Windows compatibility story (although I'm told it is possible to get it to work).\n\nSo in the end I ended up a little disappointed by what the Open Source community had to offer by way of cross-platform vector-rendering charts packages and dove into the new Mars thing, which is like PDF but defined in SVG and some Adobe-defined XML (all zipped-up together like Mozilla extensions or ODF files). Couldn't get that entirely working (though I'm still conversing with Mars engineers on their forum) and am now plowing my way through the PDF spec (which is suprisingly readable, with lots of examples, I feel pretty good about it despite the NIH).
