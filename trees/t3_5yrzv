People/cultures can believe what they will.  The question is does one culture have any right to impose its views of right and wrong upon another?  Which is what all the rhetoric in the West is all about and has been consistently.  Right from the Crusades, if not earlier.

But I don't see a state as an inviolable sacred object; my ultimate concern and sympathy is for human beings, and those feelings only extend to states insofar as they are representative of their people's will. Thus, if a state were to commit large-scale atrocities, say genocide, against its own people, then I will not stand by out of respect for state sovereignty; for I find that morally indefensible, as essentially absurd as letting a husband beat the shit out of his wife, merely because the woman chose to enter into a contract of marriage. Now, this is not at all an endorsement of military intervention, because that is almost never an acceptable solution, for many good reasons; but if something good can be done, it should be done. This is a difficult practical problem that no black or white slogans can hope to resolve, and I find both extremes, isolationism as well as interventionism, equally distasteful and unsatisfying.

On these and other grounds he would argue, and has argued, that free speech is to be preferred over censorship, for example; and more generally, that anything that forcibly restrains the ability of people to exercise themselves (responsibly, of course) is bad.\n\nWhen I say that it is possible for a culture to be superior to another, it is from these sorts of principles that I would make my case.

Most cultures make that claim, as is to be expected, though some are more forcible about it than others. For what are the alternatives? They could either say that all cultures are equally moral, which is the easy way out politically, but isn't actually something most reasonable people seriously believe. And the last alternative is rather absurd: what culture would honestly believe that they are morally inferior to others? If they truly believed that, they would try everything to change that state of affairs. So to summarize, cultures generally consider their sense of morality superior (at the very least equal) to that of others, but only the ones in a position of power generally proclaim or assert their superiority.

The net of Putin's rule is that he will leave the country in a better shape than what he inherited in 1998.\n\nClearly `osipov` does not say Putin is God's gift to earth.  If you wish to have an idea of how Russia was when Putin \"inherited\" it, see Matt Taibbi's excellent article on [Yeltsin][].\n\nI believe most people have their \"moral instincts\" in the right place.

Your lack of knowledge of Russian politics has just been exploited to feed you propaganda.\n\nIt may surprise you to find out that Kasparov associates with a group you know well -- American neocons. In fact, he has received recognition for his work and was given a board seat by the National Security Advisory Council. This organization is promoting the same policy of \"peace through American strength\" which got US into Iraq and which has a policy of dismembering Russia in order to pass control over its natural resources to Western interests.\n\nGiven such a background it shouldn't be surprising that Kasparov is a fringe candidate in Russia and is closely monitored by authorities. Imagine that in the United States, a presidential candidate was advocating overthrowing the government and making US a vassal of another state. In fact there were such candidates in the US! How many of you know of Gus Hall or Angela Davis? Both were presidential/vice-presidential candidates from the United States Communist party. Both were prosecuted and marginalized by the media.\n\nMy point isn't to argue pros/cons of alternative systems of government. My point is that each government either in the United States or Russia is concerned first and foremost about its continuity, its self-preservation. Thus, the system's enforcers(FBI, CIA, KGB) closely monitor leaders who advocate the overthrow of the system of government, whether they are Kasparov or Gus Hall.\n\nEveryone loves a good underdog story. Inviting Kasparov is a cheap way for Bill Maher to exploit the underdog perception to get rating. Actually the show has an eerily similarity to how TV shows in the Soviet Union interviewed Gus Hall and Angela Davis. The bottom line is that both sides used this approach to demonize their opponents.\n\nIs everything great under in Russia under Putin? Of course not. The media is controlled by government corporations, the corruption by government officials is a roadblock in doing business in Russia and Russia's economic policy is ineffective in dealing with problems such as inflation. However, one cannot pass judgment on Putin's government based solely on the negatives. The net of Putin's rule is that he will leave the country in a better shape than what he inherited in 1998. \n\nWhile the vast majority of Russians benefited from Putin's rule, some on the fringes did not. Most oligarchs who stole from the Russian nation under Yeltsin have had their loot taken back from them. Kasparov, like other accomplices of oligarchs lost their positions of power and influence. Now they are trying to restore their power, not by acknowledging the government's successes and offering to continue progress, but by wanting to overthrow the system.", "author_flair_css_class": null}

It's all to make putin look bad. They're trying to overthrow putins government so they can rob the russian economy more than they already have. They got money from the Rothchildes of england and bought up all the state run industry during yeltsins tenure. Then, they picked putin to replace yeltsin and got him elected by pulling a 9/11 in russia on a bunch of apartment buildings. Once they got putin elected through the false flag terror operations, Putin told them to beat it, and that he was going to run the country strictly for the benefit of russia itself, instead of these oligarch representatives of the rothschilde bank of england. Putin stopped them from setting up a banking system like our federal reserve banking system in the united states, that creates huge debt and pays interest to a cabal of european bankers that essentially control the destiny of all western countries. Putin would be dead already, in that he was like andrew jackson, or abraham lincoln in the way he went about preventing the central bank from getting hold in russia, but they put in the wrong stooge in that putin had a friend in the entire KGB as a whole. His intelligence organization was better than theirs. They couldn't get to him to wack him, so now they are relegated to throwing public relations stones from england by staging \"kgb assasinations with pulonium\" and retarded stuff like that and saying it was putin to make him look bad so they can get an insane fruit cake like Gary Kasparov elected to the presidency who would represent them. They act like he's a democratic dissident who wants to turn back the clock to \"democratic reforms\" after the breakup of the soviet union, but he's really just a celebrity fruit cake the bankers chose to attempt to get elected as a puppet so they could further pillage russia. If putin had worked for them after being elected, russia would have had a national debt now;... because he would not, now they have no debt to speak of, which is a pretty impressive thing. The goal was to sell off all the natural resources to outside interests and make it look like this new breed of antreprenure in russia was succeeding all on their own. The guy in the story went from making duckies in the arctic circle to being worth billions of pounds? It's because he had infinite money to invest from outside sources. Now, what do the oligarchs, Gary Kasparov, and the rothschilds and the owners of the federal reserve bank all have in common? Who knows?
