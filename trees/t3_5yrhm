I guess you're asking, \"Reddit, what is the best free software to help me plan my PHP application designs?\"\n\nWell, if that's the case, here's what I use:\n\n  Bluefish\n\nNo joke. I found a way in the Bluefish editor to have it identify files ending in .txt as ones that implement special highlighting. Then, I introduce special characters like *, &gt;, #, etc that mean different things as I go, such as turn on highlighting, or make something red, or whatever. Then, I use it to sort my thoughts and indicate when something has been achieved, or is super-critical, etc.\n\nHowever, I have heard recently about people using mind-mapper programs that are kind of like what you learn in college English courses where you brainstorm on paper with diagrams. These programs work with a central idea as a circle, and then sub-ideas from that circle, and then sub-ideas from that, and so on. Connections and lines are drawn between sub-ideas and things can be collapsed, expanded, and so on. There are many free ones on Freshmeat.net, gnomefiles.org, and on Ubuntu with 'apt-cache search map | grep -i map | grep -iv lib | grep -i mind'.\n", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5yrhm", "id": "c02aca6", "author_flair_css_class": null}
