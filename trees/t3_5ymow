They crammed the constitution down the throats of working class Americans, and now they keep it in place with propaganda.\r\n\r\nREAD AND LEARN. Find out what the constitution is for and why it is the way it is.\r\n\r\nLook at western europe, at Canada, at Australia. These nations have progressive taxation, they have national healthcare; most of them have far more workers' rights (such as mandatory 4-6 weeks vacation, etc); they do not spend most of the budget on the war machine like we do; most of them have mass immigration from the 3rd world under control and are now acting to stop the mass immigration flood, while it continues here in america. Almost all those other western nations have a decent minimum wage and much lower college costs.\r\n\r\nAnd their politicians are actually doing pretty much what the voters want.\r\n\r\nDo you want to know why their nations are run for and by the citizens and why America is run for and by the rich? \r\n\r\n\r\nAll you have to do is look at the structure of our constitution and the structure of the government created by the American constitution. Read what James Madison and the other rich founding fathers said and wrote about why the constitution is the way it us.\r\n\r\nHave you ever asked yourself why all those other western nations do not elect politicians from large political districts like across the entire nation as the American president is, and like the senators are?\r\n\r\nIf you read what Madison et al, wrote, you will see that they knew what you do not know, and what europeans DO know--that politicians elected from large political districts are not very accountable to the electorate. Why? First, smaller districts do not take as much money to run in. Smaller districts are more homogeneous, less diverse, so the voters in it are more alike each other, and so the politicians from those districts have to do please the voters by following their desires, whereas in larger political districts, the populace is much more diverse and less united, so the voters cannot easily unite and discover their common interests and vote in or out politicians that do or do not carry out their wishes.\r\n\r\nThat is why the other western nations are controlled by PARLIAMENTS and not by a system of checks and balances with a president and senate and unelected federal judiciary like America. Or if there is a president, the president has little power (e.g., france).\r\n\r\nAnd in almost all the other western nations, if they even have an upper house (like our senate), that upper house is subordinate to the lower house, in that the lower house actually has the final say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other western nations are controlled by their voters because the parliament actually controls the nation. The members of the parliaments are elected from small districts. You do not have to be rich to run for parliament because the districts are small and the voters can get to know who you really are without you having to spend much money. Not like here in America where the president runs for election across the whole nation and where senators run for election across whole states. \r\n\r\nAnd the terms for members of parliament are short like the House of representatives here in America. So if they do not vote the way the voters want, out they go, quickly. \r\n\r\nThe members of parliament elect the prime minister and can throw him out at any time. So $$$ does not play as big a role in the governments of all the other western nations.\r\n\r\nAnd the small districts of parliament means that the voters really know who the politician is. These other western nations are much smaller than america, so each parliament member represenats much fewer people than congressional reps do here in America.\r\n\r\nIncreasing the size of a nation means taking control away from the people and giving it to the rich.\r\n\r\nSmall nations are more controlled by their voters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn these other western nations, there is no unelected federal judiciary to keep the rich man's constitution in place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe things I am telling you are true and you can read more about them here:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://cyberjournal.org/authors/fresia/\r\n\r\nand here:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://64.233.169.104/search?q=cache:u1pjfiO0X_8J:www.historycooperative.org/journals/wm/62.2/holton.html+woody+impera&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=us&amp;client=opera\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     ", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "name": "t1_c02a1s9", "parent_id": "t3_5ymow", "id": "c02a1s9", "author_flair_css_class": null}
