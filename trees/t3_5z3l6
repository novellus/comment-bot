Watch the rerun of 60 Minutes from last Sunday.  It's painfully obvious that the catalyst to the size and devastation of these fires is global warming.  \r\n\r\nHere's the science.  The mountains of SoCal have not been getting as cold, or staying cold as late in the year.  This causes less freezing, and a higher altitude of snow and ice concentration.  Thus, when the ice melts off, it is melting earlier in the year and in less volume than before.  This makes it easier for the foliage to dry out in the dry season.  Thus, you get extremely good conditions for a fire.  \r\n\r\nAnd, yes, some of the fires were started by arsonists, but that doesn't change the fact the the fires are out of control regardless of their catalyst.\r\n\r\nMaybe it is bad that global warming proponents are using this to push an agenda, but it is an agenda that needs to be pushed, and this is a direct result of it.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
