I'm no language designer. A lot of the stuff he said went far enough over my head that I can't really discuss it in detail without making an ass of myself. \n\nThat said, here's what I can say. I'm not trying to say there's things you can't do in Python-ObjC that you _can_ do it Ruby-ObjC. Far, far from it.\n\nI think the main point is that Ruby has a more dynamic programming style than Python does. A good example would be the adding of methods to objects at runtime.\n\nSeems to me that, if I WERE a language designer (and the impression I got from the dude at the tech talks) that it would be much less crazy magic code to write a bridge in Ruby than in Python. Take into account all the interface builder stuff, for example.\n\nLastly, if you read the article in the section about Joyent and DTrace. I think a big motiviation is the seemingly in depth support for Ruby&lt;-&gt;DTrace. In Python, as I understand it, it's just a library. Wheras in Ruby they've actually gone and made modifications/additions to the runtime to support this stuff. The difference? Not so sure.\n\nLastly. It's my personal opinion that Ruby has a slightly more sane general look.\n\n`x = 1`\n\n`x.to_s #=&gt; \"1\"`\n\nrather than\n\n`x = 1`\n\n`str( x )`\n\nin python. The Python example is just not how it's done in Objective-C (at least not in Apple's frameworks, arguably the only real use for ObjC these days). In Objective-C, given a integer variable, you have:\n\n`[x stringValue]` \n\n\nor something along those lines. Maybe it comes down to both languages having lots of roots in the SmallTalk 'way'. \n\nWhich, again, is not to say that Python wouldn't work. Just that it doesn't quite match up to the ideas that Ruby/Objective-C has about how to code.\n\nDisclaimer: I regularly write code in Ruby _and_ Python. I am not hating on Python at all! At my job we use Python as part of our automated test system and Ruby would not fit there!
