As viral replication falls, the CD4 count increases, but whether the CD4 count returns to the level seen in HIV-negative people is unknown. We aimed to assess whether the CD4 count for patients with maximum virological suppression (viral load &lt;50 copies per mL) continues to increase with long-term cART to reach levels seen in HIV-negative populations.\"\n\nWould this mean good news for everyone?\n\n\"our findings are only generalisable to patients who have an optimum response to cART and should therefore be regarded as a best-case scenario. Up to 30% of patients starting cART will not achieve viral suppression and the CD4 counts in these patients will not increase to the same extent.\"\n\nAnd what were these best-case-scenario results?\n\n\"Patients who started cART with a CD4 cell count of more than 350 cells per \u03bcL had CD4 cell counts approaching the level seen in HIV-negative individuals after more than 3 years of cART and had no further significant rises in CD4 counts.\"\n\n\nSo good news, of a sort, but this is really just a more detailed understanding of how cART works, when in fact it works.\n\nGood research, but in many cases and the most general terms, HIV is still unbeaten.\n", "author": "owo", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 6, "parent_id": "t3_5yui3", "id": "c02alzw", "author_flair_css_class": null}
