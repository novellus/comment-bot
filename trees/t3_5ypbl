Joanne Kaufman wrote last Monday on the NYT ('Clear the Bookshelf and Fill It Up Again, All Online') about BookMooch, \" a book-swapping Web site created a year and a half ago by John Buckman, a bibliophile who describes himself as a \u201cwealthy ex-dot-com person.\u201d\" The concept is very simple - BookMooch lets you give away books you no longer need in exchange for books you really want. Buckman created a system based on points, where according to the site \"every time you give someone a book, you earn a point and can get any book you want from anyone else at BookMooch. Once you've read a book, you can keep it forever or put it back into BookMooch for someone else, as you wish.\" And yes, it's totally free.", "author": "ronenkroch", "created_utc": "1192831900", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5ypbl", "id": "c02a5vb", "author_flair_css_class": null}
