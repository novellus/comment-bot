You can exercise due diligence but if a company is lying about it's battery of tests, you're screwed. What the FDA does is it investigates the testing process that companies perform and assure the validity of them. When there was no agency companies/people lied constantly to sell a product (and still do, except the FDA comes in and shuts them down as soon as they get wind of it).\n\n&gt;i know that i would never take a pill that didn't have proper research behind it. with or without the fda, i look into pills that i am to take for my ostensible benefit.\n\nAnd you should. The FDA doesn't replace this process. Your doctor should be researching them too. The FDA doesn't replace that either. The FDA protects the consumer from fraud. This kind of fraud is particularly dangerous so it takes a special organization to monitor it.\n\n&gt;additionally, reasonable standards can easily exist without requiring a publicly funded agency to enforce them.\n\nThe FDA enforces rational scientific testing processes. What is considered reasonable by the public at large and what is scientifically reasonable are two different things.\n\nI get the whole libertarian utopia bit, but taking away certain protections from the populace against deception and fraud that can seriously hurt you seems a bit over the top.
