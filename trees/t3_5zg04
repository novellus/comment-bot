The New Zealand soldiers do not wear camo, they wear suits with flak jackets underneath. They do not carry anything except pistols, and they do not produce them unless threatened. They do not war reflective sunglasses, and they work under the principle \"That we are here to make friends, not enemies. We are here to protect people, not kill them.\"\n\nApparently they are universally liked and respected, and no one in their care has been attacked, killed or kidnapped. The soldiers have not killed anyone either. Nor have any of these soldiers been injured or killed.\n\nContrast that to Blackwater's performance.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
