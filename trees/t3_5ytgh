There was a really big production called Desert Storm that lit up people's televisions for about a week.  I think that was a fairly popular show, and got good ratings.  It was loud and bright and apparently heroic.  After that though, dot coms and boy bands became far more interesting.\n\nSome people were vaguely aware that there is a state there called Israel that we are really good friends with.  They didn't really know why though.  All they knew was that the friendship was unconditional.\n\nImmediately following 911 the same 90% that were blissfully unaware of the Middle East suddenly, and with great help from our \"leadership\" and the media became experts on the region.  They recognized that:\n* all the men wore beards.  Most believed that this made them sinister because the villains in our movies wear beards.\n* all the women were oppressed and needed liberation.\n* all the children were being brainwashed and indoctrinated to hate us (US).\n* most people in the Mid East were either involved in 911, or knew someone who was.\n* something had to be done about you, and the US was going to have to be the country to do it since hardly any other nation wanted to be involved.\n\nThe 10% that had some understanding of the history of the past 50 years tried in vain to communicate to the majority that:\n* Saddam Hussein was actually put in power by the US as was Bin Laden.\n* There was no connection between the two, and that philosophically the two would have been at loggerheads.\n* The vast majority of the suicide pilots were in fact Saudis.\n* At the core of this geopolitical struggle was basic economics, and that the people in power were using us to enrich themselves.  \n\nThey failed because the media and the extreme right wing managed to convince the majority that the minority were at best simple kooks, and at worst anti-Americans.  The 90 thusly ignored the 10, and went out and bought more Chinese made vinyl flags for their absurdly large vehicles.\n\nIn the intervening 6 years, the 10% has made progress.  The number people who understand some or all of what is going on, and has been going on, has grown.  Their number might be as high as 25% now.\n\nHowever sadly the Christian right is still far more concerned with whether homosexuals in Massachusetts can get married then they are with the number of Iraqi children missing limbs as a result of the bombs that were bought using their tax money.\n\nBy the election of 2006 enough people had either joined the enlightened, or were simply fed up enough with the war that they voted the controlling party out of power.  To their surprise and dismay though that effort didn't appear to change anything.\n\nAt this point I'd say that more than 50% of the people in the US have a LOT in common with people of the Middle East.  We can't stand our Federal Government, but we feel helpless to do anything about it since the most basic mechanism by which we are supposed to be able to affect change, our political process, has apparently failed us.  We're scared to do much more than this because we know that we'll be branded as dissidents in the media, and shot down in the streets by American made weapons, fired by Americans.  Poverty, unemployment, and lack of health care ravage the nation, and many people I know have already run out of ideas and selected their favorite country to run away to.\n\nIn conclusion, as it stands now, a bit less than half of us wish you would shave your beards, and the other half of us are dreadfully sorry for everything that our Government has done.  But all of us wish that the Middle East would recognize that we're in a bit of a pickle over here, and cut us a bit of slack.", "author": "everymn", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c02akyc", "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c02akyc", "parent_id": "t1_c02aipl", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 3, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5ytgh", "retrieved_on": 1427425822, "body": "Do you want to know how the Middle East really sees the US? Let me tell you from the point of someone who just left the middle east and is an arab and a muslim.\n\nWe dont care about the middle east. Thats about it. We like americans, we think your funny and fat, obnoxious and when we meet you in real life we treasure you as friends, we think your a walking talking contradiction but we dont care because you understand friendship and trust and thats what really matters not politics or dogma. What we dislike about America is your government and your invasive foreign policy.\nHeres something you dont understand, we Arabs actually hate dictatorships. We are the last people who want to see the Sauds rule arabia, nor the Nahyans rule the UAE or the Sa'ids in Oman or Gadafi in Libya or Assad in syria etc etc etc. We cant stand them. But believe it or not theres nothing we can do about it, when we tried to revolt against the Saudi dictatorship we were shot down in the street with weapons made in America and labeled dissidents in your Media. Sadly we get the rough end of the stick as on one hand your government gets nice and cosy to these leaders whilst at the same time we are blamed for not trying to revolt. The fact is, we admire America as a bastion of freedom and peace, a country which we wish we could imitate. Do you know the last time The middle east had peace? Every generation that is born into the middle east is born into a land of war, and you wonder why it gets worse and worse as time progresses. If you were born into a country that was scattered with bombs, where people you knew and grew up with were killed you would understand the animosity and hatred we can hold to those who punish us for no reason. \n\nSure there are some bad people frmo our society, as is with any society but we should be the ones to deal with them, we should be allowed to dictate our own lives and not be treated as monkeys who have no idea about the world. \n\nSo in conclusion as is stated by almost ever arab on the earth, we like you americans (most of you) but we cant stand your government and your fetish for sending soldiers to our countries to \"liberate\" us. Were not the wild wild west, were not red indians so please stop sending cowboys to shoot us.\n\nEdit: Perhaps one of you could be kind enough to tell me what an American thinks of the Middle East.
