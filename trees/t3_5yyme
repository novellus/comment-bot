The state, both federal and state-wise, got involved mostly for health reasons 100 years or so ago.\n\n&gt;But this should be a religious matter. All voluntary associations, whether they're economic or social, should be protected by the law. But to amend the Constitution is totally unnecessary to define something that's already in the dictionary.\n\n&gt;We do know what marriage is about. We don't need a new definition or argue over a definition and have an amendment to the Constitution. To me, it just seems so unnecessary to do that. It's very simply that the states should be out of that business, and the states -- I mean, the states should be able to handle this.

It doesn't address the issue since marriage is not just a religious act.\n\nHere. Let's look at when he says \"All voluntary associations, whether they're economic or social, should be protected by the law.\" Is that the case now? Which tax forms do gay couples get to use when they want to file jointly? Where is the legal backing for a gay couple to make medical decisions for the other when they are gravely ill? Why is it a fight or some huge search to find a job where the insurance will cover your gay spouse?\n\nNo. He does not say what you are implying. His quote, in black and white, is clear.

Well, actually it's ok to discriminate against a minority since all these states have bills in place prohibiting gays from having marriage and civil unions already. You know that's going to be fun and wind up back in federal court. State marries gay couple. Gay couple has insurance. Moves to another State that prohibits gay marriage and will not recognize such a union from another state. Couple can no longer retain the policy.
