The machine has a \"head\", which is the position it is on the tape; the machine can write symbols to its head.  The machine's behavior is defined in terms of the \"input symbol\" and the symbol at the head.  The machine can increment or decrement the head position and write symbols.\n\nA Universal Turing machine is a machine (as defined above) that can perform any computable computation.  The question is, which machines are Universal Turing machines?  It says an interesting thing about the universe to see *how simple* you can make a Turing machine and have it be Universal.  Do you see?\n\n**The controversy**:\n\nIn this proof, Alex Smith proposes a proof that a particular simple state machine (like a Turing machine) can be universal according to some combinations of ideas.  According to the strict definition of a Universal Turing machine, the starting \"tape\" may only contain an infinite *repeating* pattern as an initial condition.\n\nIn his proof of the Universality of 2,3 he assumes the existence of a Turing machine whose \"tape\" has an infinite *non-repeating* pattern as an initial condition.\n\nThis is controversial because the traditional definition of Universality does not permit such a start condition, but yet it seems intuitively useful to consider such a machine Universal.  The reason it is intuitive is because the pattern in question is very simple, \"computationally weak\" according to Wolfram Research.\n\nThroughout history concepts like \"function\" and \"set\" have been refined many times.  There is no divine definition of these concepts.  If you adopt Frege's definition of 'set' then you admit [Russel's paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox); so, we redefine set to be more useful as in [ZFC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFC).\n\nThe controversy here is not whether this machine is actually, traditionally Universal under Minsky's definition (it isn't) but whether the new intuitive definition of Universal implied by this proof is actually the more useful one.  \n\nWith an arbitrarily complex infinite pattern you could encode any computation into the simplest machine.  Future research will perhaps discriminate which initial conditions which are infinite non-repeating patterns are legitimate to construct \"Universal\" machines.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2fwo", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c02c3hb", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 5, "link_id": "t3_5zeh6", "retrieved_on": 1427425014, "body": "I don't get it . . . can someone boil this down for a lay man, please?", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5zeh6", "id": "c02c3hb", "author_flair_css_class": null}

Sloppy is not the right word because there is nothing divine about this particular definition of Universal.  The point is that if you adopt these slightly different rules about what is Universal, you achieve a result that seems to make more sense.\n\nIt is not the case that definitions of concepts in mathematics should remain unchanged forever.  The thing about definitions is that they are completely arbitrary -- there is no \"better\" definition.  Maybe I will define the class of Xiphorian Functions, which is every function whose codomain doesn't contain the integer 1.  Is this definition useful?  No, probably not.\n\nPicking useful definitions is *all about intuition*.  Definitions are really about communication between mathematicians -- they are language about math.  After all, how many times has the definition of \"function\" or \"set\" or whatever been re-defined to be more useful?  There is no divine definition of a \"set\"; it just so happens that if you use Frege's definition of set, you admit certain undesirable [paradoxes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard%27s_paradox).  There is nothing that makes this definition \"wrong\" -- it's just not as useful for communicating ideas.  Therefore more useful definitions of \"set\" were developed such as in [ZFC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFC).  It is this way with our definition of what constitutes a Universal machine.\n\nThe point is that the *mathematical* definition of a Universal machine follows from the *intuitive* definition.  In this case, upon learning the properties of these machines, intuition suggests that we should actually classify machines like this with Universal machines, and not with non-Universal machines.  That is to say, it suggests we should extend our definition of \"Universal\".  Future research will perhaps discriminate which initial conditions which are infinite non-repeating patterns are legitimate to construct \"Universal\" machines.\n\nIn the same way that you \"want\" [Russel's paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox) not to apply to your definition of \"set\", so do you probably want this proposed machine to be considered Universal.\n\nI could divide all the functions of the universe of discourse into various categories as trivial as the set of Xiphorian Functions, complete with rigor and candor.
