So in closing never thought I would say this but picture or it didnt happen, except in G. Gordon Libby and Rush's head.  I admit though that they were mostly faddish but I hate political urban legends true legends are damning enough.\n\n*edit since I did not look it up before I commented let me note that it is a very controversial issue that since most accounts did not pop up until the early 80's appears to be just an urban legend although it may be  a misremembering of PROwar protesters spitting on anitwar protesters.

As in the most extreme measure and fastest one a generation can take to to get rid of the debt is to overthrow the very means of economics. Sure we can fix our debt, over time but like I said the this generation has little say in what corporations do or the government do for that matter. I was taking the articles negative point of view into hand as well, its far less worse than what the article suggests. \n\nNah i don't think it will get rid of our shortcomings and its is naive to believe that. But the internet is going to hold politicians to higher standard hopefully. Godwilling the the influx of information on the internet will create smarter voters who will look up articles and issues about what their candidates are saying. The thing is the internet is much different from radio and television. Radio television and even newspapers are almost all controlled by a few media corporations, the internet isn't. If you look around your always going to find articles that the mass media would never report, blogger accounts etc.Also hopefully people wont use just one source of information and will find at least three to correlate something or figure a way to find its trustworthy. But its hard for yellow journalism to exist when everyone is watching each other ready to take a bite out idiocy and gain some site hits.  Take my first comment for example, I called someone out on on what i thought was a terrible sensationalist article and then you called me out. Thats the power of the internet.

Fine.\n\nFirst, you cite 'historical' examples, though your understanding of history is rudimentary at best. Yes, Vietnam employed the draft, but most of the fighters were volunteers, so you pulled that 'quarter' statistic out of your ass.\n\nSecond, you say that an economic crash will happen if we try to fix the national debt. Have you studied economics? On what basis do you predict this 'crash'? World War 2 and Reagan put us through unprecedented debt before; we got ourselves out of it. There's always a way to fix things.\n\nLastly, you say that the internet will become a kind of political arena that will be more open and honest than traditional forms of debate. Now, I do think that the internet has great potential, and it's heading that way, but to think that this sort of thing will rid democracy of its shortcomings is naive at best, and dangerous at worst. There will always be stupid people who vote for stupid things, and unscrupulous politicians to take advantage of these stupid people. Ever heard of the \"Tyranny of the Majority\"? It's the concept that the masses are easily swayed by temporary sentiments that cloud judgment, and hence cannot make the 'right' decisions. The internet, with its accessibility and speed, will only exacerbate that. Do you really think reading postings on the internet is much different from hearing news on the radio or television?
