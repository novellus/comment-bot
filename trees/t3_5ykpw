That is the lesson of every single revolution in history.\nYour just a middle class gate guardian apologist for the administration and I think that is just disgusting.\n\nUntil you started personally attacking me, you had a point.  Its great you assume things about me based on my decisions.  I couldn't agree with you more that government shouldn't be given power, I am a Libertarian for the most part.  I am challenging your distortion of what is being done and the reasons it shouldn't be done.  Dismissing me with name-calling does nothing.\n\n&gt;Innocent until proven guilty. That was supposed to be enshrined within our legal code. Nothing new has occurred to change that mandate.\n\nAnd I agree, I was merely posing the question, although you must admit that letting murderers free to kill people is quite a price to pay for letting not jailing innocents.  That position must be taken humbly.\n\nI also ask, though, why \"innocent until proven guilty\" applies to everyone but those you disagree with?  I constantly hear all of this speculation and condemnation of the President, etc, when there is nothing but speculation.  We don't know his motives, but the Democrats seem eager to dismiss him.  Frankly, many of the officials who have stepped down in his cabinet, etc, have never been charged with anything, it was all speculation.  Innocent until proven guilty?  How about be fair and consistent.\n\n&gt;You try rotting in jail for a crime you didn't commit. Or being the husband of that poor woman who died in airport police custody. You face having your life destroyed by some stupid government fuck up and then come back and tell me how the innocent should be treated.\n\nAgain, you read into my statements.  I never proposed jailing innocents if you read what I said, and frankly, it is coloring everything you say about me because you infer things based on your preconceived notions of me.  *That* is irresponsible.\n\nI don't want any innocents rotting in jail, but obviously, because we are *human* there are going to be mistakes, sadly.  That is called wisdom and reality.  That \"poor woman\" was an alcoholic that killed herself, and while tragic, it was one of those mistakes.  I feel for her family and the pain she was going through, but sadly it was a mistake and we don't always need to be pointing fingers.\n\nThe final, and largest, problem with your accusations is that saving the \"innocent\" by making people feel for the person who was wrongly accused *absolutely ignores* victims.  What about that murderer who is set free on technicalities because we want to never jail an innocent and kills a child?  Where is the compassion for that child and its family?\n\nYou have to remember: basing your arguments on compassion in a public sphere is dangerous.  Having compassion for one group or individual means you can't have compassion for another.  Compassion for the person with a \"not guilty\" verdict on a technicality means that we can't be also showing compassion for the family of the new victims when that person turns out to be a murderer again.  Compassion for the criminal in a dealth penalty case by giving life in prison means there cannot be compassion for the victims of that murderer or the victims' families.\n\nThat is a lesson in life, and hopefully you'll be honest enough to see that.\n\nHave a nice day.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 6, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5ykpw", "retrieved_on": 1427426118, "id": "c029vr8", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "name": "t1_c029vr8", "parent_id": "t1_c029vgn", "body": "How is my fear not a valid one?

The economic policies put into place by the Bush administration (tax cuts for wealthy taxpayers, incentives to create low-paying, low-security jobs for workers, etc.) have greatly accelerated the accumulation of wealth by the already-wealthy, leading to a great discrepancy in purchasing power and, hence, the power to shape and take part in society. Concentration of power and wealth is an oligarchical characteristic.\r\n\r\n2. The unprecedented secrecy of this administration makes one think that they do not believe it is necessary to involve the governed people in the government. This, too, is an oligarchical characteristic.\r\n\r\n3. There is enough evidence to suggest that the previous two presidential elections featured improprieties to at least consider the proposition that some parts of the administration are willing to go beyond the rules of civil law in order to achieve and maintain power. This, too, is consistent with what happens in oligarchies.\r\n\r\nThere are more I could come up with, but those are three major characteristics of the Bush administration found in governments that are already oligarchical in nature or seek to become oligarchies.
