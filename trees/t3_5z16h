My public school was one of the few public schools in the city that refused to teach to the test and instead encouraged us to work on meaningful individual projects. As a result, my school had a high rate of graduation and sent several kids to top-tier universities. \n\nThe common link was that the adults in my life did not coddle and baby the children in their lives. They encouraged us to think and grow. They were hands-on, but not overbearing. Concerned but not obsessed. \n\nKids today aren't genetically deficient.

Everybody I knew in elementary school was routinely punished.  Getting spanked, grounded, having things taken away, these were all normal.  If a teacher threatened to call home, it was serious.  Teachers used this sparingly as the threat was usually good enough.  Kids didn't have a lot of junk, allowances were fairly rare and we found ways of entertaining ourselves.\n\nIn the Bay Area it was the exact opposite.  When teachers threatened to call home, the student would often just tell them off.  \"Go the fuck ahead, they won't do shit.\"  Kids were spoiled as hell, and it wasn't entirely uncommon to see a $100 a week allowance.  Parents seemed to care more about their kids being perceived as poor than being perceived as stupid or criminal.\n\nOur school had some ESL (English as a Second Language) classes, but I don't think it had a particularly significant contribution to what I was seeing.
