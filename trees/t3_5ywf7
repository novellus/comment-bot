Either you are with the United States or you are with the current Iranian regime.  The gross majority of the anti-war left doesn't support Ahmedinejad, or support Iranian human right abuses (just look at all the work done on the issues by the the left-wing Amnesty International or Human Rights Watch.)\n\nThe Iraq War has killed upwards of 500,000 people.  But this author probably thinks that was a good thing, it was worth it from his safe vantage point in the West.  The problem is that the US is not competent at this regime change for democracy thing, especially the way it goes about thing using lies and deception.\n\nThis author says he supports the Palestinians as well, but why does he support the military option against Iran but believes in negotiation when dealing with the Israel-Palestinian conflict?\n\nI think this topic deserves an essay, and hopefully when I get some time I'll write one on this topic.
