If i am wrong to call them terrorists please could you define the difference between rebels and terorists as i see no diference between rebels and terrorists in this news. Al-qaeda is a terrorist organisation but pkk rebel one. because al qaeda kills people in the west and pkk attacks Turkish people in the east of west.
