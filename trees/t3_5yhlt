Frivosity has nothing whatsoever to do with it.  Hell, frivolous things are often the best things to patent.\r\n\r\nThe first and most important test that a patent application must overcome is that it must *not* be obvious.  While that is often a tricky thing to define, the fact of the matter is, if you have a process that takes a customer 5 steps, any moron in the world would look at that and say, \"Gee, is there any way I could reduce that to fewer steps?\"  It's the very definition of \"obvious.\"\r\n\r\nNow, if Amazon wanted to patent a specific WAY of doing that thing, *that* would be patentable.  Let's say they had a surplus of monkeys and decided to implement a system wherein whatever input the customer begins would be completed by a room full of monkeys (something I sometimes suspect they do anyway), then THAT would be patentable.  Having monkeys complete a process is non-obvious, and specific enough that if someone else did attempt to implement a Monkey Click System, it would be infringement.\r\n\r\nAmazon, instead, invented the Monkey Click System, then attempted to broadly patent ANY method of allowing the customer to make a purchase with a single click.
