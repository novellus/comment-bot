With all respect, is it *that hard* to figure this out?: \n\niPhone: 2 weeks after start, Apple lowers price $200. BUT to the loyal first-adopters they offer $100 in Apple store credit -- nearly WORTHLESS. No excuse for this.\n\niPhone: Apple doesn't want anyone to use a non-ATT phone system with it, so after it was hacked -- by a teen-ager -- they make a system update that turns your iPhone to an iBrick if you used the hack. \n\niPhone: Apple blocks 3rd party apps from working on it after the system update. Then they decide, what the hell, and no longer put that in the update.\n\nOur business purchased 12 G3's at the same time. Around 2 years later they all began to crash -- final 'no recovery' crash, mind you -- one after the other. Fell like dominoes. Built-in decay? Obsolescence? You be the judge.\n\nI have a Dell 233 that's been running since 1996.\n\nFirst iPods: 18-month unchangeable battery?

You are sort of agreeing with me, and sort of not. Not that I really think the only reason is that people are afraid of change.\n\nThe iPod made huge inroads when it was released, and even though a few other companies have put out comparable products, they are also competing with the iPod 3rd party universe. The Mac is competing with the Windows 3rd party universe. The selection of software packages and professionals to implement are hard to compete against.\n\nYes, there are different perspectives at play as well. Windows (and Linux) provides a dizzying array of options that allow you much more control over what you are doing. That's great for the professional or motivated hobbyist. Sort of like the auto tuning market.\n\nThe Mac tries to only give you the options Apple thinks you need, regardless of what *you* think you need. This is exemplified in the iPod by the lack of integral FM tuner. This approach put off many hobbyists, but it was a breath of fresh air for anyone who just needed to get stuff *done*. My friend's Mac saved my ass when I needed to write my Masters thesis but got bogged down in trying to figure out the very powerful word processing system (Interleaf) the school used.\n\nThings have changed a bit with OS X. There is much more control, but more inconsistency, as many long-time Mac users will point out.\n\nI'm not certain where you are coming from with regards to the anti-customer comment. Many people would say the customer support is excellent, but I admit it does waver. Perhaps looking at the bar they've set for themselves, their support isn't great, but compared to other companies it seems fine.\n\nI laughed when I heard about complaints about the first iPods scratching. Nobody ever complained in the news about their ugly Samsung or Motorola phone getting smudged or scratched, and you should see what my Palm looks like. But because the iPod *was* a thing of beauty out of the box (compared to the competition), people expected more from it, much to the consternation of Apple.\n\nAnyway, I'm ok with agreeing to disagree. Steve Jobs started off with 4% share and making a profit. I'm sure at 8%, he's crying all the way to the bank.\n\nBTW, that's the first time one of my comments fell off the face of the earth.
