Many times worse than the 40's Holocaust.\n\nThat's what Hindu Kush mountains mean; \"Hindu Killer\".\n\nSo the Muslims then colonize India; implementing a systematic genocide on the worlds most ancient civilization. Most Hindu temples were destroyed and used on mosques.\n\nThe Muslims ruled India right up till the British, and then they still held some power. All this time, Hindus were being killed.\n\nEven in Hyderabad, you might know this city as an IT hub, after Indian independence, the Muslims leader didn't want to join the Indian union. So he let out Razakars (rapists, killers). Eventually, Hyderabad joined India.\n\n\n\n\nSo what I'm saying is this, Hindus have long dealt with Muslim barbarity. The riots of 02 were only started after **a train car full of Hindus was set afire**. \n\nThe Muslims are the spawn of the invaders. They have no right to be in India. The Hindus are the most ancient civilization (that's why Germans like them). \n\n\nAs you can see, Islam is a *global* problem, not just Indian, or American.
