I don't know the exact figure, but I'm pretty sure it was over fifty.\n\nThey were so cheap that, rather than pay for an SSL certificate for each site, they bought a single certificate, and sent every payment for every website through a single hostname\\*.\n\nDue to this and various other reasons pertaining to how our \"e-commerce solution\" was implemented, once the payment had gone through, the user was redirected back to the individual site, which displayed the order that had just gone through.\n\nOf course, to do that, it would need to know exactly *which* order to display.  Do you think they redirected to a generic URI that checked the session to figure out the order?  Of course not.  They redirected to http://example.com/show_order.asp?order_id=1234 instead, which displayed the customer name, billing address, all their credit card details, and what they had ordered.\n\nOf course, absolutely no checking took place, so anybody curious enough to change that number could view any order ever placed on that particular site, along with the customer's credit card details.\n\nNot long after I started there, the lead developer was moving on to a better job elsewhere.  The week he was leaving, we received an irate phone-call from a client who had figured out just how insecure his \"totally secure online shop\" was.  So we fixed it, right?  Right?\n\nOne of my first jobs at that successful, established, in-business-for-many-years, had-local-government-contracts web development agency was to go through each and every online shop we had and change it so that the redirect used POST instead of GET, meaning that it was still just as insecure, but now our clients wouldn't notice.  And no, I couldn't fix it properly, because the lead developer had left very specific instructions and I was the newbie.  For all I know, it still works that way.\n\n-- \n\n\\* This was actually necessary at the time if you were using name-based virtual hosting, but we were perfectly capable of doing it properly because we were using IP-based virtual hosting with a different IP for each site.\n", "author_flair_css_class": null}
