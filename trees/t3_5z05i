I hated qwerty.  I thought there was something wrong with me.  Then I switched and it was the best thing I could have done.  I type at 40wpm in programming.  I have a blog and if I have to, I can increase my typing to 80wpm and sometimes above 100.\r\n\r\nI doubt I can ever type slower than 20wpm on qwerty so switching back is never a problem.\r\n\r\nThe real advantage in dvorak is the reduction in finger movement.  Most keystrokes are on one row.\r\n ", "author": "Vorlath", "created_utc": "1193308229", "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "archived": true, "subreddit": "programming", "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_5z05i", "id": "c02b7ty", "author_flair_css_class": null}
