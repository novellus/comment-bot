I think that's rather uncharitable.  Preaching to the choir?  Which choir?  Those who believe in evolution?

However, evolution is intertwined with religion in a fight to provide a narative for our origins, which is a separate issue from its unintuitive results.  Wikipedia does not have any such fights with religion.  It makes sense that one can leverage insights into the way Wikipedia flouts common sense into how evolution flouts common sense.
