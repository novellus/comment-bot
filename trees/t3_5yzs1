With that said...\n\n\n&lt;rant&gt;\nI think the word \"science\" has been perverted in regards to computational theory.  If this article referred to \"science\" in the classical sense, it would posit that the Turing machine is complete, and that proved something about the fundamental laws of nature.  However, it does not do so.  No new fundamental laws of nature are revealed.  No confirmation of existing theories result.  It's effectively meaningless.\n\nLest you think I am confusing the so-called field of \"computer science\" with physics, I am simply wondering out loud why a theory such as this should be considered to have import as pure science.  It's information theory, pure and simple.  Is it not?  Maybe the possible actions of particles in the universe correspond to this model and maybe not; who has proven it's relevant?\n\nI think the temptation to computer scientists and mathematicians has been to equate advances with \"computer science\" (and I very purposely use the quotes there) or information theory with advances in physics.  It's tempting to think that because a such thing as a Turing machine exists that nature must use such a thing in its machinations.  It's tempting to project such simplicity, such rationality into nature.  NKS implicitly theorizes that such a thing is possible; that the universe does operate to the dance of the automatons (for lack of a better phrase).  But then, does it really?  Are classical physics explainable in this paradigm?  How about relativistic physics?  How about quantum physics?  \n\nUnless NKS can unify physics as a whole, I don't see how it will ever be more than a curiosity.\n\n&lt;/rant&gt;\n\nI do wish that NKS would be successful in this regard, but it's much more likely that the methodology that Wolfram has employed will likely point to patterns which are explainable at a much more fundamental level; that is the patterns shown by automatons will be true at some level, but the actual physics will be at least an order of magnitude more complex than anything NKS could imply.\n\nBut, hey, that's just a guess.  :+)", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "programming", "name": "t1_c02b5e0", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "ups": 1, "link_id": "t3_5yzs1", "retrieved_on": 1427425527, "id": "c02b5e0", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02b3pb", "body": "Proving a non-trivial equivalence of some cellular automata and a universal Turing Machine is Mathematics - or Theoretical Computer Science if you will.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2fwo", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 2, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5yzs1", "retrieved_on": 1427425549, "body": "&gt; it's just regular plain old science\n\nNot trolling, but where exactly is the science in this?", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02b3pb", "parent_id": "t1_c02b1zr", "id": "c02b3pb", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2fwo", "ups": 3, "name": "t1_c02b1zr", "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5yzs1", "retrieved_on": 1427425571, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02b1zr", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02azxo", "body": "Wolfram manages to f*ck that up with the sentence: \"It's a thoroughly nice piece of NKS work.\"\n\nIt's not a NKS, it's just regular plain old science.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "programming", "ups": 36, "name": "t1_c02azxo", "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5yzs1", "retrieved_on": 1427425598, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02azxo", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5yzs1", "body": "It's cool that it was proven by an undergraduate.", "author_flair_css_class": null}

This review is the product of my lifetime of experience in meeting important people and thinking deep thoughts. This is a new kind of review, and will no doubt influence the way you think about the world around you and the way you think of yourself.\n\nBigger than infinity: Although my review deserves thousands of pages to articulate, I am limiting many of my deeper thoughts to only single characters. I encourage readers of my review to dedicate the many years required to fully absorb the significance of what I am writing here. Fortunately, we live in exactly the time when my review can be widely disseminated by \"internet\"\ntechnology and stored on \"digital media\", allowing current and future scholars to delve more deeply into my original and insightful use of commas, numbers, and letters.\n\nMy place in history: My review allows, for the first time, a complete and total understanding not only of this but *every single* book ever written. I call this \"the principle of book equivalence.\" Future generations will decide the relative merits of this review compared with, for example, the works of Shakespeare. This effort will open new realms of scholarship.\n\nMore about me: I first began writing reviews as a small child, where my talent was clearly apparent to those around me, including my mother. She preserved my early writings which, although simpler in structure, portend elements of my current style. I include one of them below (which I call review 30) to indicate the scholarly pedigree of the document now in your hands or on your screen or committed to your memory:\n\n\"The guy who wrote the book is also the publisher of the book. I guess he's the only person smart enough to understand what's in it. When I'm older I too will use a vanity press. Then I can write all the pages I want.\"...\n\nIt is staggering to contemplate that all the great works of literature can be derived from the letters I use in writing this review. I am pleased to have shared them with you, and hereby grant you the liberty to use up to twenty (20) of them consecutively without attribution. Any use of additional characters in print must acknowledge this review as source material since it contains, implicitly or explicitly, all future written documents.   \n\nEdit: (This is pulled from Amazon, not original to me.
