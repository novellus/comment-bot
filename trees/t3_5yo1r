The chance is probably not very big now, but it will grow if the surveillance system is allowed to extend.\n\nYou will probably not have a live human listening to you, but some voice recognition software, listening for a list of sensitive words. You know, like \"terrorism\", \"bomb\", \"Islam\", maybe even \"child porn\". Once the software recognizes one of these words, your conversation is recorded for later review by a human agent.\n\nThe reviews for perhaps 99% of the recordings will turn out negative. Probably 1 in a billion recordings will contain genuine information, and help stop a terrorist plot, or a pedophile.\n\nThe problems with this system will be twofold: misunderstanding, and abuse of authority. \n\nMisunderstanding occurs when your stupid joke gets interpreted as plotting for a terror attack, or an admission of having child porn on your computer. This will probably result in the local SWAT team breaking into your house the following night, ravaging the place and confiscating your computers. Of course, they will find nothing; but pray they won't feel too embarassed as a result, and press some bogus charges anyways. Kind of like what happened to [this guy](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A8278-2004Jun1.html).\n\nAbuse of authority is also ripe to occur, since the wiretapping process is considered a matter of \"national security\", and will thus happen secretly, with very little supervision. Basically, any agent with access to this information can use it for his or her own purposes, with little restraint. This can result in business espionage, private acts of vengeance, or even plain old stalking. \n\nOf course, if you're John Doe and don't really care much or talk about politics, the chances that any of this will affect you are pretty small in the beginning. But if the wiretapping powers increase at the current rate, it will probably be only a few years before you'll really have to watch out that  what you're saying on the phone can't be misinterpreted, and to try and stay out of the way of any individuals working for the wiretapping agencies. (Which might be a little difficult, since they're not exactly open about it. But not sleeping with the neighbor's wife, and not being a good looking young female, should go a long way towards that.)", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02a518", "parent_id": "t1_c02a3d8", "id": "c02a518", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1427425968, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "archived": true, "name": "t1_c02a7e6", "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5yo1r", "downs": 0, "score": 3, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02a7e6", "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": "1192852290", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "politics", "ups": 3, "parent_id": "t1_c02a3d8", "body": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"distinguished": null, "controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "politics", "archived": true, "name": "t1_c02a8s7", "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5yo1r", "retrieved_on": 1427425950, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02a8s7", "author": "chu", "created_utc": "1192880790", "author_flair_text": null, "edited": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_c02a3d8", "body": "I would think most John Does aren't naturists for a start.
