For starters, Mr. Blair may be just trying to stay in the spotlight but in the spotlight he is and his comments made news not just because of who he is but also because of what he said and those comments should not be \"utterly ignored\". \n\nThere are many points in this article that should be taken seriously. First, Mr. Blair is correct when saying that the US and Britain have many shared values that are at odds with Iran, but he fails to note what those shared values are and why they are so important that the two nations should stand up against Iran.  \n\nSecondly, Mr. Blair's claims that Iran is a state, \"that is prepared to back and finance terror in the pursuit of destabilising countries whose people wish to live in peace\"  has to send a chill through someone's spine other than just myself, considering that the US and Britain are two nations whose people do wish to live in peace but it is our leaders who are backing and financing terror in the pursuit of destabilizing other countries who also wish to live in peace. \n\nRather than allowing the nations of the Middle East to have their own customs and ways of life which may differ from ours, the US and its allies have \"provoked them\" by trying to make them share the same values we do. But, would Iran attack the US if it had the opportunity? I don't know and neither does anyone else. Does Iran have valid reasons to resent us? Sure they do, just as many other countries do, and this is where Mr. Blair is correct in saying that simply leaving Iran alone now would not ensure that they would not retaliate against us if able to do so. however, Mr. Blair's call for the US and Britain to \"stand up\" against Iran is ludicrous because that kind of behavior is part of what got us here in the first place. Rather the two nations (should they decide to act alone) should sit down with Iran and try to build a relationship that may hopefully reconcile some of the problems that have occurred in the past and may be the fuel for future clashes. \n\nTo make a long point short: Yes, Tony Blair did use a charity dinner to once again be in the spot light, but what he said while standing on his soap box should not be disregarded but rather used to understand and question where our political leaders are coming from and where they intend to go.", "author": "i_digress", "created_utc": "1193071736", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t1_c02a1o2", "id": "c02al1k", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c02a1o2", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 4, "link_id": "t3_5ynip", "retrieved_on": 1427426042, "body": "Blair: Irrelevant, inconsequential, trying to stay in the limelight.
