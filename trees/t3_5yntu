This year Fantastic Four Halloween Costume is very popular. \n\nWhat sets Halloween costumes apart from costumes for other celebrations or days of dressing up is that they are often designed to imitate supernatural and scary beings. Costumes are traditionally those of monsters such as vampires, ghosts, skeletons, witches, and devils. There are also costumes of pop culture figures like presidents, or film, television, and cartoon characters (for example the fantastic four halloween costumes are popular this year). Another popular trend is for women (and in some cases, men) to use Halloween as an excuse to wear particularly revealing costumes, showing off more skin than would be socially acceptable otherwise.\n", "author": "zach64rick", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "score": 1, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5yntu", "id": "c02a21h", "author_flair_css_class": null}
