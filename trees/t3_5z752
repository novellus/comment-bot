This part threw me for a loop, though:\n\n&gt;A few economists have speculated that if you lowered taxes by 5%, you would gain revenue. No mainstream economist today is in that camp. Republicans often are, but Republicans know nothing about economics.\n\nThat would imply that we are currently over the hump of the [Laffer curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve), which is extremely unlikely given how low tax revenues are in this country. Any economist who honestly thought that the US would increase tax revenue by lowering taxes should hand in his Ph.D immediately; the economics of the Laffer curve are simple and fundamental.
