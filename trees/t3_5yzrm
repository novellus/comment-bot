To pull a building down is to, literally, pull a building down, not to cause its fall with explosive charges. \n\nThis video is friggin' laughable. It's amazing that tr00thers keep referring to  Larry Silverstein's \"pull it\" quote as though it has damning evidenciary value. It doesn't.  More than six years, and tr00thers can't produce anything more than \"Larry said pull.\" Produce some extraordinary evidence for your extraordinary claims or go away.
