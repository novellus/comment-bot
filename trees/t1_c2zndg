The general idea is he used whatever concepts that helped the monks understand the practice and pursue it (they did not even have a word for 'brain' or 'amygdala'). After enlightenment, though, there no longer is a view of 'self' and thus no more talking about rebirth (rebirth of what?) as the Buddha [explains](http://www.handfulofsand.com/zen/archives/000520.html) to an about-to-be enlightened monk,\n\n&gt; If an enlightened person holds on to the idea that a self, a person, a living being, or a life span exists, that person is not an authentic enlightened person.\n\nIf none of this makes any sense to you, head over to read about [Upaya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upaya)\n\nAs far as the 'materialistic' point of view is concerned, keep in mind that,\n\n1.

However, as rational as many of the Buddhist points of view are (and I agree with most of them), they still came to believe in reincarnation, which still seems like magical thinking to me and a sign that a more scientific approach is still needed.  Until some more modern \"scientific\" research is done I'll stick with the material point of view which is still the only one that works objectively, though I do have an open mind for the Buddhist philosophy and have for some time.
