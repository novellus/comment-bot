Chemicals can be released from plastic packaging materials like the kinds used in some microwave meals. Some drinking straws say on the label \u201cnot for hot beverages.\u201d Most people think the warning is because someone might be burned. If you put that straw into a boiling cup of hot coffee, you basically have a hot water extraction going on, where the chemicals in the straw are being extracted into your nice cup of coffee. We use the same process in the lab to extract chemicals from materials we want to analyze.\n\nIf you are cooking with plastics or using plastic utensils, the best thing to do is to follow the directions and only use plastics that are specifically meant for cooking. *Inert containers are best, for example heat-resistant glass, ceramics and good old stainless steel*.\"\n\nergo, most plastic is pretty unstable. i know plenty of people who leave bottled water in the car, without realizing that it can be reaching very high temperatures. we're just incredibly nonchalant about this shit. i'm not being alarmist when i say this is not particularly bright on our parts. i haven't said anything about reusing bottles or freezing them, but plastic is generally toxic. and the stuff we use to make plastic is toxic:\n\n\"[About one fifth of the waters contained synthetic organic chemicals](http://www.nrdc.org/water/drinking/bw/exesum.asp) -- such as industrial chemicals (e.g., toluene or xylene) or chemicals used in manufacturing plastic (e.g., phthalate, adipate, or styrene) -- in at least one sample, but generally at levels below state and federal standards. *One sample contained phthalate -- a carcinogen that leaches from plastic -- at a level twice the tap water standard, but there is no bottled water standard for this chemical*; two other samples from different batches of this same water contained no detectable phthalate.\"\n\nand so you don't think i'm being alarmist, here's the greater context:\n\n\"For purposes of comparison, we note that EPA recently reported that in 1996 about 1 in 10 community tap water systems (serving about one seventh of the U.S. population) violated EPA's tap water treatment or contaminant standards, and 28 percent of tap water systems violated significant water-monitoring or reporting requirements. In addition, the tap water of more than 32 million Americans (and perhaps more) exceeds 2 parts per billion (ppb) arsenic (the California Proposition 65 warning level, applicable to bottled water, is 5 ppb); and 80 to 100 million Americans drink tap water that contains very significant trihalomethane levels (over 40 ppb). Thus, while much tap water is supplied by systems that have violated EPA standards or that serve water containing substantial levels of risky contaminants, apparently the majority of the country's tap water passes EPA standards. Therefore, while much tap water is indeed risky, having compared available data we conclude that there is no assurance that bottled water is any safer than tap water.\"", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "ups": 1, "name": "t1_c02abu2", "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5ynre", "retrieved_on": 1427425910, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02abu2", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "parent_id": "t1_c02abq0", "body": " &gt;my contention has been that bottled water isn't safer than tap.\n\nThat doesn't sound like \"plastic is toxic\" to me.
