Real spy networks are formed from the disaffected and the weak. One of the most common methods of gaining informants is to find some poor sap who's cheating on his wife or a closet homo and blackmail them into spying. If you do it right, they might not even know that they are spying on their country.

We wouldn't be in Iraq. The intelligence community was right on all points. They just were ignored and had their data manipulated.\n\nFor that matter, our occupation of Iraq would have gone a lot better if we hadn't reduced our Intelligence networks in response to the end of the Cold War.
