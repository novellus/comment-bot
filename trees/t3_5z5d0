Most people will go \"OMG walloftext ohnoes!!\" as soon as the page loads and not even read the first 100 comments, so it would end up being a huge waste of resources.  I could go for somewhat larger pages, but I really think most people don't bother reading all the comments anyway and just want to jump in with their own.\n\nWhat I would really REALLY like is an option to turn off the \"show more comments\" stuff in the MIDDLE of the page.  That is unbelievably annoying.  Here I am, reading the first 4 or 5 comments in a subthread, and now I have to click and wait to get the last 1 or 2 comments?  Ugh... I HATE that!  Make that an option in the preferences.\n\nI really think out of the two options (quoting someone in a first-level comment and ending up on page 2 or 4, or replying in a subthread and ending up on a secondary subthread page), the latter is by far the worst.  All the annoyance of clicking and waiting for a whole page of comments, but only getting the 1 or 2 comments in that subthread, and then having to do that over and over just on the first page.\n\nedit:  forgot to mention, I upped you because I think it's a good idea for discussion.\n", "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": "t3_5z5d0", "ups": 2, "author_flair_css_class": null}
