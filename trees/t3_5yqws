There is nothing like a comparison of the risk of a kid getting raped by a fellow student, and the teacher. The only numbers they do give sound fairly low to me. 2500 out of 3 million teachers? Of course they try to imply there are probably many more. But this is really just a guess.\n\nSo there is a less than a one in a hundred chance that a teacher is molesting anyone. Probably thirty students per teacher, per year, adding up to something like a thousand over a career. Lets just pull a number out of a hat and say that each teacher molests ten students I don't know if that is accurate, but it gives me a starting point. That leaves something like a 1 in 3000 chance of a kid getting molested by his teacher.\n\nI suspect the kids have a lot more to fear from family members and other kids. Sure, get rid of the bad apples, but don't pretend like teachers are a horrible threat to your kid.", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "name": "t1_c02aa60", "parent_id": "t3_5yqws", "ups": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null}
