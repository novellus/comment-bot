Nuclear fission is a stupid technology.\n\nBussard's Polywell Fusion reactor has no radioactive fuel. No heavy radiation when running (assumes Boron as a fuel). No possibility of melting down.

(Water may be used for cooling though.)\n\nIt's only slightly larger than a shipping container.\n\nThis reactor is going to change the world. Utterly.\n\nForget Fission.
