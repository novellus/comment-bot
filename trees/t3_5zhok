It\u2019s a stealth issue. One day you wake up and every single news outlet in the country is owned by one company. You just didn\u2019t realize how bad it was until too late.\n\nFree Press, undaunted, is pushing back. They are asking any and all members of the public who are concerned about the state of localism and consolidation in today\u2019s media landscape to rally at the hearing. The event will take place on Wednesday, October 31st, at:\n\n9 a.m. ET\nFederal Communications Commission Headquarters\n445 12th Street SW\nWashington, D.C.\n(map)\n\nI urge anyone in the DC area who is concerned about media issues to attend. I will try and make it myself (though, of course, I have work that day, like most people). If you can\u2019t attend, Free Press has other ways to get involved.\n\nTo stay updated you may want to subscribe to our RSS feed: http://www.theseminal.com/feed/", "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": "t3_5zhok", "ups": 1, "author_flair_css_class": null}
