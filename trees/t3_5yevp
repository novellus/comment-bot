Why, if it's sexual, does it carry a harsher penalty, than if it were a beating? Is it that the victim is a woman? Is it just another american thing, where any time sex is mentioned, people's brains shut down?

Can behavior itself waive such? What is the distinction that makes any rape a more heinous crime than an otherwise similar assault? Is it something magical, so otherworldly that you hesitate to nail it down for fear of blasphemy?\n\n&gt; Whether an attack is rape doesn't depend on whether one likes the victim's conduct\n\nIt just depends on what part of the body was assaulted.

If you say that under some circumstances a person can be forced to have sex against her will without it being rape, then yes, you're saying in those circumstance she has no right to consent. \r\n\r\nThis is just textbook, not a personal attack. If a person has a right to consent, it's rape; if she doesn't, it isn't.\r\n\r\nThis is why forced sex with the king was never rape in feudal times. Legally, a woman had no right to refuse the king. \r\n\r\nIn modern times, until the last 30 years or so, many states had laws that a woman had no right to refuse sex from her husband. No matter what he did to her, whether she wanted it or not, whether she fought and struggled against it, it wasn't rape. In some states, even if they were separated and he broke into the house, or she was in a coma, it still wasn't rape...because she had no legal right to refuse her spouse.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you're overlooking the fact that a woman legally has a right to withdraw consent. In most jurisdictions, she can withdraw consent even after the act has begun. Some don't allow her to withdraw consent after penetration, but I don't know of any jurisdiction that says a woman can't withdraw consent up to penetration. I would say at the point he had to point a gun at her to get what he wanted, any consent that existed before can safely be said to have been withdrawn.

I don't question that rape might warrant a harsher punishment.\n\nI'm asking: What exactly is it that it requires a harsher penalty, and if that thing is waived or dismissed by the victim, does it warrant the harsher punishment?
