They forgot to tell the scientist this key part of the plan and he went ahead and fixed the flaws, fearing that giving them the plans would endanger his life since the flaws were apparently pretty easy to spot. This fuck up was almost as bad as when they accidentally outed nearly EVERY covert agent in Iran with a single email sent to a triple agent.
