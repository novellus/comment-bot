If the cops raided Microsoft head quarters they would find coke heads by the ton but they dont because they have money and they stay out of problem neighborhoods where the cops are being slammed to bring crime down(it actually boils down to local politics in this regard).  As far as pulling the race card it is a matter of perception.  I am white I dont get pulled over and I dont get harassed(I also tend to dress always in a suit to not look like white trash either and put myself beyond questioning) so I should not care how the drug war is perceived but since it causes potential social unrest and related crime against people who look like me because people who look like me put them in gladiator school(prison)it does become my problem.  I also find it difficult to not see the correlation to crack having extreme sentences and cocaine having light sentences since when this was changed back in the 80's crack at that time was a black urban problem and white America was scared to death of it.  Remember back to the debates that took place over changing the sentencing guidelines and you quickly see a bunch of frightened people trying to not bring race into a discussion that was drenched in racial issues and problems.  The real danger I see is happening now.  African Americans distrust our nation our government and our wars more and more, of course they are not alone in this but that is dangerous to the stability of the nation.  They are no longer joining the military which is hurting over all enrollment and more and more of them are in single parent homes with their fathers off in prison.  When someone tells that kid to \"blame whitey\" you dont think they will, or do you think that they do not hold enough power to threaten you our your family members?  I just think that it is important to not only treat everyone fairly but to be perceived to be doing so as well, if not those that feel mistreated historically have rose up sooner or later and destroyed those standing on their necks themselves or with the help of outsiders with their own agendas.   \n\n*I also want to apologize if this is coming off as confrontational since many of the debates I have had with you are confrontational.

Pulling the race card out of your pocket isn't going to win you this one.  The fact that more black people are in jail than white people for drug related crimes has nothing to do with government stereotyping or an elaborate scheme to get blacks behind bars.

If you don't believe me, ask Bill Cosby.\n\n&gt;Also crack is a recreational drug to the poor like cocaine is to the middle and upper classes no more dangerous, no more addictive just cheaper.\n\nThat's partly true.  The issue is that people who can afford to do cocaine in the middle and upper class rarely get caught doing so because that is the only crime they commit.  When you mix addictive drugs(crack) with poverty you begin to see - as we have seen - an outburst of violence due to increased demands for the drug and lack of money to obtain the drug.
