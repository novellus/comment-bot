I guess we'd better prohibit both because if Hilter saw something in them that he approved of then they must be bad?  The logic is crude at best.  You can't actually point to a policy that is racist, but yet you insist that it must be there.\n\n&gt;You people brought this on yourself with your lies and deceit...Americans don't like being lied to. Just ask George Bush.\n\nI don't even understand what this means.  Are you accusing me of being a Bushy?  I'm afraid this makes you insane.
