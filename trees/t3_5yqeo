That's what it would take to get a scientifically valid study at this point in time.\r\n\r\nNo it isn't.  If that were true then we would have NO scientific research on the cause of any disease.  You are making absolutely absurd statements with no sourcing.\r\n\r\n[Pre-clinical research is a valuable tool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research#Preclinical_research) and when pre-clinical research indicates the possibility of a cause and effect relationship, then clinical trials are devised to test the possible cause and effect.\r\n\r\n&gt;Don't be ridiculous. \"Pervasive disorders\" like autism can easily have multiple causes. Do you believe breast cancer has only one cause?\r\n\r\nWe aren't trying to find \"the cause.\"  I've already told you that vaccinations are not the cause of autism. People get autism with and without vaccinations.  If you'd pay attention you'd be better informed for this discussion.  We are trying to RULE OUT vaccinations as a possible catalyst for increasing the numbers of cases of autism.\r\n\r\n&gt;Currently, there are no substantial populations of unvaccinated children that are similar enough to the general population to draw any kind of conclusion.\r\n\r\nYes, there are.  There are thousands of children each year who are not being vaccinated. My son is similar enough to the general population to be included and there are plenty of typical parents who are electing not to vaccinate.\r\n\r\nThat is the whole reason we are arguing is that you initially complained that my son might give other children whooping cough, which you MISTAKENLY believed kills half of all children under the age of five who contract the disease.  Part of your complaint was the increasing number of children in the general population that aren't being vaccinated.  You can't have it both ways.\r\n\r\n&gt;All you have not vaccinating now in substantial numbers are: 1. Reproductively isolate religious groups 2. Families where the mother has a low level of educational attainment.\r\n\r\nNo, the very article that created this comment section says otherwise.  It says that non-religious parents are claiming religious exemptions.  By the thousands each year! \r\n\r\n&gt;I hardly need parenting advice from the likes of you.\r\n\r\nWell, it certainly won't do any good!\r\n\r\n&gt;Unlike you, I have a child working on a science degree at a USNWR top 5 ranked national research institution.\r\n\r\n&gt;(Lot's of bragging snipped)\r\n\r\nI don't need to brag about my accomplishments and education in order to support my statements.\r\n\r\n&gt;A child who up till 11th grade, learned most of her science at home, not school.\r\n\r\nDid you teach her that half of all children under the age of 5 who contract whooping cough die from it?  You might want to call and correct her on that.  Anything else you got wrong?\r\n\r\n&gt;You keep fixating on polio to justify yourself. \r\n\r\nNo, you are talking to the mirror.  I never bring up polio.  I only respond to when you say things like this:\r\n\r\n&gt;And then there's the issue of wanting him to be susceptible to polio. Even if he survives that, there's the paralysis, the respiratory damage.\r\n\r\nI don't bring up polio, you keep bringing it up even though there is virtually no realistic chance that it is an issue at all.\r\n\r\n&gt;You do realise it's just an example, right? \r\n\r\nIt is a bad one.  You should learn about what you are discussing and post useful examples that support your position, if you can find such things.\r\n\r\n&gt;That vaccines cover numerous diseases that children still die from every year?\r\n\r\nI do agree that they cover NUMEROUS diseases.  Way more than I was vaccinated for as a child.  But since you make that statement, I would like to (futilely I'm sure) ask for your source on that.  Show me the NUMEROUS diseases that kill children each year that we vaccinate for - and for reality's sake, let's keep that here in the U.S. since we aren't planning a mission trip to Thailand anytime soon with our infant son.\r\n\r\nAnxiously awaiting your reply...\r\n", "author": "tsteele93", "created_utc": "1193245003", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_c02aypu", "id": "c02b27n", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1427425526, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "archived": true, "ups": 1, "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5yqeo", "downs": 0, "score": 1, "body": "[The experts still getting it wrong...](http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/thrive/2007/oct/19/101902665.html)", "author": "tsteele93", "created_utc": "1193272233", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "c02b5ha", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "politics", "name": "t1_c02b5ha", "parent_id": "t1_c02aypu", "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "politics", "name": "t1_c02aypu", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "ups": 1, "link_id": "t3_5yqeo", "retrieved_on": 1427425613, "id": "c02aypu", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "parent_id": "t1_c02ayly", "body": "&gt;You could easily find volunteers among parents, like myself, who are not vaccinating.\r\n\r\nYou would volunteer your baby to grow up in a lab so that all variation between him and a vaccinated child could be carefully controlled for?

If you think, as you keep arguing, that the results of a scientific study determine whether or not the methology is acceptable, you simply are not rational enough to make informed decisions.\r\n\r\n&gt;There hasn't been a case of Polio in the western hemisphere since 1991.

That is why a **thinking person** might want to investigate the possible cause and effect relationship that might exist between autism and vaccines, but that same **thinking person** might reasonably decide that there is no reason to do studies on seemingly unrelated things like rap, sunspots and ufos.\r\n\r\nI'd also point out that ufos, sunspots and rap music are not injected into a child's body while they are developing an immature neuro system.  To a **thinking person** this would indicate a great deal less likelihood of there being a relationship between those things &amp; autism and vaccinations &amp; autism.\r\n\r\n&gt;Denmark In November 2002\r\n\r\nThis is a study based on vaccines with thimerosal vs autism.

The overall average was 6.6 in 1,000 children, or about 1 in 150. \r\n\r\nIn other words, the autism rate in New Jersey is three times that of Alabama. Do you really think three times as many people in New Jersy vaccinate their kids as in Alabama? Or that New Jersey vaccines are made differently?\r\n\r\n&gt;the CDC has made no effort to study a possible link between astonishgly huge increases in the number of children with autism and vaccinations.\r\n\r\nThey haven't studied the link between autism and UFO activity either. Or sunspots. Or rap music.\r\n\r\nJust because some right wingers dreamed up a crackpot theory doesn't obligate the CDC to go out and study it. Especially when there is no way to get scientificially valid results from such a study.\r\n\r\nNot to mention that fact that other studies appear to rule out a link:\r\n\r\n&gt;Denmark\r\n&gt;In November 2002, a study reported a lower incidence of autism in Denmark than in the US and other countries. An incidence of 1 in 727 (738 out of 537,303) was reported, compared with up to 1 in 86 among primary school children in the United Kingdom and around 1 in 150 children in the USA. Danish authorities also reported a continued increase in the incidence of autism after 1992 after withdrawal of thiomersal-containing vaccines.[12] Data presented in 2003 shows a clear increase in incidence between 1990 and 1995 (before the criteria changed). Thus, the increased incidence of autism after the removal of thiomersal was not a measurement artefact.[13]\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt;[edit] Japan\r\n&gt;The Yokohama study in Japan (2005) examined the incidence of autism before and after the 1993 withdrawal of MMR, reporting 48 and 86 cases per 10,000 children in two sequential years before withdrawal, doubling to 97 and 161 per 10,000 afterwards in the two years afterwards.[14][15]\r\n\r\nIt studied over 30,000 children (278 cases) born in one district of Yokohama.[16]\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_(incidence)\r\n\r\nFrom the same source:\r\n\r\nUnited States\r\n \r\n&gt;Reports of autism cases grew dramatically in the U.S. in 1996\u20132005. It is unknown how much, if any, growth came from changes in autism's prevalence.The number of diagnosed cases of autism grew dramatically in the U.S. in the 1990s and early 2000s. For example, in 1996, 21,669 children and students aged 6\u201311 years diagnosed with autism were served under Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) in the U.S. and outlying areas; by 2001 this number had risen to 64,094, and by 2005 to 110,529.[20]\r\n\r\nAutism rates have gone up dramatically since the 1990s.

Wade but Connolley vs. Green.\r\n\r\nNot only did you not know these things, you acted skeptical, then when I provided links instead of acknowledging them, you lied and said I didn't provide them or claimed baselessly that they were in some other thread.\r\n \r\n&gt;you have somehow taken a discussion about whether I choose to vaccinate my son or not,arrived at the conclusion that I am too hostile towards women (???) to continue debating the issue.\r\n\r\nExhibit 1: Your repeated lies about links you claim I didn't provide, and your refusal to acknowledge those links with even a simple thank you.\r\n\r\nClearly hostile behavior.\r\n\r\nExhibit 2: Your opposition to exceptions to abortion law to save the life of the mother except in cases of rape or contraceptive failure. \r\n\r\nLet me repeat your words again:\r\n\r\nME:\r\n\r\n?But if the woman WAS too \"lazy\" to take birth control, and she'll die without an abortion, tough luck to her. Is that her just desserts?\r\n\r\nYOU:\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt;Well, if I'm too \"careless\" to look over my shoulder when merging in traffic and a semi runs me over, I may die. Life is full of consequences for the careless and lazy.\r\n\r\nAnd this really is the last reply I will make.

I believe we could rule it out 90%-95% and move on to searching for more likely answers.  \r\n\r\nThat's my point.  We DON'T KNOW what is causing the increase in autism.  You've suggested several things in your posts besides vaccinations.  If the Amish are getting vaccinated at a MUCH LOWER RATE than the general population, but getting autism at the same rate as the general population, then it would clearly indicate that we should concentrate our research in other, MORE LIKELY areas.  It would also, for me as a parent, be convincing enough to go ahead and get vaccinations for my child.\r\n\r\nIt wouldn't be 100%.  But right now, we don't know at all.  That would be good, solid evidence that vaccinations were not a likely cause.\r\n\r\nThat's why I say you are playing a semantics game.  You can claim there is no way to test and you can claim that without double blind controlled experiments that there is no way to know, but the reality is that you CAN get useful information from a study like this.  It won't prove anything 100% in and of itself, but it could provide enough evidence to point you in another direction.\r\n\r\nOf course, we are arguing a moot point, because from what I've seen the Amish do NOT get autism at anything remotely LIKE the rate of the general population.  That information indicates that we SHOULD do further research into the possible role of vaccinations and the increase in autism.\r\n\r\n&gt;This simply isn't how science works. The difference between 1. ruling something out and 2. suspecting, but not being able to rule it out is more than just \"semantics\".\r\n\r\nSo do you believe in Evolution?\r\n\r\n&gt;Anyone who can't distinguish between those two things probably isn't even competent to make his own medical decisions, much less decisions for his wife and child.\r\n\r\nAh, another ad hominem attack.\r\n\r\n&gt;People on your side of the political spectrum have ALWAYS opposed vaccination for one reason or another. \r\n\r\nLet's play a game.  Here's response 1.  Response 1 is a ration discussion of the issue:\r\n\r\nNo, that is incorrect.  I was vaccinated as a child and fully planned to vaccinate my son until I learned of the possible autism link and did some research.  When I learned how many questions remain unanswered, and when I considered the common sense questions like \"what happens to a newborn child's neurodevelopment when you jumpstart an immune response to dozens of serious diseases all at once in a way that would never happen in nature?\" and \"why is thimerosal - a mercury based preservative - being used in vaccines that are injected in children?\" I decided not to follow the crowd.\r\n\r\nHere's response 2.  This is a response that mirrors your typical responses:\r\n\r\nPeople on your side of the political spectrum have always been sheep, following whatever the experts say is the rule of thumb at that time.

The original excuse not to vaccinate was that it cheated God if planned to kill you with an infectious disease.\r\n\r\n???\r\n&gt;Your position that except in cases of contraceptive failure or rape, there should be no exception to abortion law to save the life of the mother is appalling.\r\n\r\nI've never said any such thing.  Why would you lie about that?\r\n\r\n&gt;If your own wife or daughter became pregnant via consensual, unprotected sex, and developed life-threatening complications of pregnancy, you would really sacrifice her on the altar of your political beliefs?\r\n\r\nNo.  Where did you get this nonsense?  I've never said any such thing!\r\n\r\n&gt;This is why I don't take it seriously that your vaccination decision has anything to do with health. \r\n\r\nNo, you don't take it seriously because that would be a challenge to your \"thinking.\"  By putting me into a category that I do not fit into, it makes you comfortable.  You label me \"neocon religious nutcase\" (even though I've repeatedly said I am an agnostic Libertarian) and then you can relax and not have to pay attention to any of the arguments, sources and reasoning that I have given to suggest that there might be a link between vaccinations and autism.\r\n\r\nBy labeling me and marginalizing me, you can comfortably dismiss my words and not worry about whether I am right or not.\r\n\r\nIf you treated me like an intelligent human being with a different opinion than you have, then you'd have to consider the opinion and apparently that would be too uncomfortable for you to deal with.\r\n\r\n&gt;You're not about preserving life; you're about feeling powerful by inflicting your will on vulnerable individuals.\r\n\r\n???\r\n\r\n&gt;I thought about this today, and frankly, I cannot continue to have a conversation with someone so deeply hostile to women. Good day.\r\n\r\nIn other words, you've been losing this argument source after source and instead of continuing to face the fact that you are being taken apart piece by piece, you will put a false label on me, walk away and pretend I wasn't up to your standards so you didn't need to consider what I said anyway.\r\n\r\nLet's face it, you have somehow taken a discussion about whether I choose to vaccinate my son or not, and arrived at the conclusion that I am too hostile towards women (???) to continue debating the issue.\r\n\r\nThat's kind of nutty.\r\n\r\nHopefully you did get one thing out of it though.  You do know that \"half of all children under the age of 5 who get whooping cough\" DO NOT DIE FROM IT - RIGHT?\r\n\r\nAnd consider this.

If the Amish are getting autism at the same rate, it still wouldn't prove that vaccinations aren't a factor.\r\n\r\nIf the Amish are not vaccinating, but they are getting autism at the same rate as the general population it would be a very strong indicator that vaccinations are not a catalyst for autism.  Do you understand logic?\r\n\r\n&gt;It could be that the Amish have some other characteristic that cancels out the effects of the vaccine. \r\n\r\nStatistically speaking - no.  That would be so unlikely as to be virtually zero.  If you could show that a large unvaccinated population was getting autism at the same rate as the general vaccinated population, you could make the decision to concentrate your limited research dollars on more promising solutions.\r\n\r\nThis is called \"common sense.\"  An analogy would be colic.  My baby had colic.  No one knows what causes colic.  Our pediatrician suggested the baby take Zantac.  We also heard that cutting out dairy and nuts from my wife's diet while she was breastfeeding might be helpful.  We did both and the colic went away.  We decided to discontinue the Zantac and see what happened.  The baby still does not have colic.\r\n\r\nUsing your \"logic\" we cannot know the dairy and nuts were the cause and we should still continue the Zantac.  We are comfortable with basic logic and simply discontinuing the nuts and dairy in my wife's diet.\r\n\r\n&gt;There are too many variables that affect humans and law and ethics forbid us from rounding people up and raising them in the lab so we can control for all the variation the way we can with rats or flies.\r\n\r\nYou could easily find volunteers among parents, like myself, who are not vaccinating.\r\n\r\n&gt;You don't understand. If a study isn't valid if it shows result \"A\"; it's also invalid if it shows result \"B\". Science just doesn't work the way you think it does. The validity of results doesn't magically change if you get the answer you want. Whether the results are valid depends on the METHODOLOGY, not the outcome.\r\n\r\nYour method is to do nothing at all and sit back and claim there is nothing that can be done.  My method is to use flawed, but useful studies that can indicate with a high degree of likelihood whether vaccines are the cause of increased rates of autism.\r\n\r\nSitting on your hands and acting like nothing is wrong isn't a solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt;If the Amish have a lower rate of autism, it's more likely to be due to genetic drift or lifestyle issues, such as diet, exposure to toxins, etc.\r\n\r\nAgain, if the Amish have a lower rate of autism, then you don't publish a cure.  You see that as a sign that it may be useful to take the next step in studying populations who have, and have not, been vaccinated and compare their rates of autism.  I've never suggested that the study of the Amish will determine absolutely if vaccines are causing an increase in the rates of autism.\r\n\r\n&gt;Consider this: huge increase in vaccinations in the Third World over the last 20 years. Yet no concommitant explosion in autism. \r\n\r\nSource?\r\n\r\n&gt;If vaccinations were doing it, places like Africa would be experiencing skyrocketing autism rates too.\r\n\r\nSource?\r\n\r\n&gt;Yep, our borders are completely sealed. Absolutely no one comes here from another hemisphere. And if they do, they're 100% free of communicable diseases.\r\n\r\nThere you go again, taking practical, usable odds and comparing them to silly unrealistic absolutes.  There hasn't been a case of Polio in the western hemisphere since 1991.  It was declared eradicated in 1994.  So, while theoretically it is possible that someone could get it, THEY HAVEN'T IN OVER 15 years.\r\n\r\nIn your fantasy world, \"might\" trumps \"almost certainly will not based on evidence.\"\r\n\r\n&gt;you're willing to bet your child's life on it.\r\n\r\nYes, I am.  I've clearly said that over and over.  That is part of being a parent.  You bet your child's life on a car seat.  You bet your child's life on which car you drive and whether you drive in the rain or the snow and whether you fly on a plane, etc...\r\n\r\nThat's part of parenting.

You seem to have mistakenly (again) decided that we believe vaccinations cause autism.  I've clearly stated that is not the case several times in this discussion.  Our position is that autism is increasing at an alarming rate and the CDC has done a poor job of researching whether vaccines might be a significant factor in this increase, so we aren't going to take that chance until our child is much older than the immunization schedule calls for.  I really think that I've been clear on that.\r\n\r\n&gt;But I guess if you're so anti-autistic people that you'd rather see a child get polio than turn out like Bill Gates, none of this is going to mean much...\r\n\r\n[Wow, I thought we'd covered that.

Or could it be that the \"geeks marrying geeks\" hypothesis is more likely?\r\n\r\nBut I guess if you're so anti-autistic people that you'd rather see a child get polio than turn out like Bill Gates, none of this is going to mean much...", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "politics", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 1, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5yqeo", "retrieved_on": 1427425631, "id": "c02axed", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02axed", "parent_id": "t1_c02awhl", "body": "&gt;By the way, just how do you think they're going to do double-blind tests under controlled conditions using matched sample populations to \"prove\" that vaccinations don't cause autism?\r\n\r\nYou don't prove autism is caused by vaccinations.  It clearly ISN'T.  Unvaccinated children can get autism.\r\n\r\nHowever, you can do a study of unvaccinated children vs vaccinated children and see if there is a significant difference in autism rates.  One study HAS been done (not by the CDC though) that found that Amish children, who are rarely vaccinated, have exceptionally lower rates of autsim vs the general population.  The CDC says that the significantly different gene pool of the Amish makes the results meaningless.\r\n\r\nI agree that it makes them unusable and indefinite, but I disagree that it makes them meaningless.  I would consider that to be a valuable data point that would steer my research towards the next logical step...\r\n\r\nFollow the many people like myself, who are avoiding infant vaccinations and compare them to the vaccinated public.  Compare the rates of autism and see if there is still a significant difference.  If there is, then you have a \"smoking gun\" and it is time to start finding ways to design the tests to determine if vaccinations are triggering higher levels of autism in children today.\r\n\r\n&gt;You do understand why experiments like that on children are illegal, don't you?\r\n\r\nClearly there are plenty of studies that can be done to further implicate, or rule out vaccines as a factor in the astonishingly high rates of autism in the world today.  Don't be disingenuous.\r\n\r\n&gt;And you do understand why the small sample of people who don't vaccinate their children is so deviant from the general population that even if a correlation were found, it wouldn't say anything about CAUSATION?\r\n\r\nHow am I deviant from the general population.  According to the article there are thousands each year.  As for your claim that it wouldn't say anything about causation, so what?  If there is a correlation, then it would warrant further research.  Finding, or disproving a correlation is the first step.\r\n\r\n&gt;You can't rule out genetic or envirnomental causes using a population like the Amish, the Quiverfull or the FLDS that's reproductively and occupationally isolated from the rest of America.\r\n\r\nAs I've said, I am aware of this.  But if you find a correlation, then you should pursue it further.  If you find that Amish kids are getting autism at the same rate as the rest of the population, then you have solved the problem.  Perhaps you are unable to understand that you don't have to prove autism is increased by vaccinations, you could also potentially prove it ISN'T increased by vaccinations.  That would put people like me at ease and solve the problem.\r\n\r\nBut I bet you that isn't the case, because I bet if the CDC could easily show that unvaccinated children get autism at the same rates as vaccinated kids, they'd be trumpeting that banner on the front page of their site.\r\n\r\nThe CDC has two objectives that I do not have.  First, they need to cover their butt.  They've been pounding vaccinations forever and they would suffer grave credibility problems if it were found that they had been carelessly harming infants over the past decades.  Second, they are looking at a big picture where eradicating a disease is more important than causing harm in a smaller segment of the population.\r\n\r\nAll I care about is making sure I protect MY child.\r\n\r\n&gt;Nah, how could you understand something like that? \r\n\r\nWell, you know - like how I understood that Whooping Cough doesn't kill \"half of all children under the age of five\" who get it?
