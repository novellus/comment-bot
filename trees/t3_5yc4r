It's more like the perfect storm of bullshit. \n\nWe have the minds behind much of the executive power grab (and war on terror, including Iraq, destroying civil liberties and the such) in people like Dick Cheney, Wolfowitz, and Rumsfeld. [Read up, their agenda was no secret](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pnac)\n\nBut Dick Cheney couldn't have pulled it off on his own. That's why they have George Bush. He's the \"aww shucks\", down to earth, have a beer at the blue collar watering hole, sort of guy. He's also has that blind confidence/arrogance that many could see as strength. He is the perfect messenger for the message PNAC peddles. \n\nAnd of course, you had 9-11. Such random and callous killing had never been perpetuated on such a scale on American civilians at home before. (Pearl harbor happened yes, but it was on the military, on a base on a small US territory as close to asia as it was the heartland). This made Americans increasingly susceptible to the administrations wants and needs. People wanted to feel safe, and people wanted revenge. (People still do. My own relatives deep in blue state territory think that our next president needs to get tougher on terror. )\n\nFourth, was lack of a Democratic opposition to Bush Admin policy. Democrats had a majority in the senate, but only Feingold protested passage of the Patriot Act. Far worse was the lack of debate and patience leading up to the Iraq War. If there was ever a time where Democracy failed in America, it was then. \n\nI think all of this sort of gelled into what we have today. I don't think there was a mass movement, or outright authoritarianism (put on the masses, there is when it comes to torture and habeas corpus of enemy combatants.) There was slight demonization of Islam, but I don't think to the extent of the Nazi's and the like. \n\nI also don't feel we can blame \"corporations\". That's too simplistic and weak. While I have no doubt some corporations have benefited from the war, Cheney was also in government far longer than the private sector. I think the actions of the administration have been far more nuanced and intellectual (neoconservatism) than simple profiteering. Ditto for \"OIL!\" being the sole reason.
