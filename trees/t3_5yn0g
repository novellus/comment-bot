It had short/wide plates like those used in most foreign countries.  \r\n\r\nDue to it having a bumper sticker that said \"England\" I assumed at first that it was from out of the country, but as I got closer I noticed that the driver was on the left (thus, probably not from England), and then I noticed that the license plate had a blue bar on the left side that said USA.  There were two seals in the center, but they were too small to read.  There was a plastic dealer style frame that said Pentagon Motors, which made me think of DC, but when I search Google I just find a Used Car dealer in the UK.... so, some things make me think that it's from the US, others from the UK.  What gives?  The plate most definitely said USA on the left side.\r\n\r\nI'm baffled, and was hoping that somebody here could clear up my confusion!", "author": "twowheels", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "id": "c02a0df", "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": "t3_5yn0g", "name": "t1_c02a0df", "author_flair_css_class": null}
