It's the operating instructions of the best system yet. When every citizen can flash their copy of the Constitution at un-American authority and quote chapter and verse, the greed-heads will all disappear back under the rocks where they belong. The way I see it, we're at an historic cusp. We can either remain on our path of destruction, or we can change America back to the post WWII ideal as exemplified in the 60's. The America of opportunity, where a guy with a sixth grade education could work at the same job for 20 years, supporting a family, a house and a couple of cars in the interim. I'm not advocating we all revert back to a sixth grade educational level, of course, but if we're so much smarter now, how come we work longer and harder than our parents did? For less?!\r\n\r\nWe need to create real change in our country if we're to save any of it, and it appears to me that Kucinich is the only candidate talking about doing what it takes. The rest give us nothing but the same old, with a twist. Rearranging the furniture just won't do it anymore. We need to put all the furniture on the front lawn to see what's worth saving in the light of day. The rest should be immediately kicked to the curb with all the other trash. Electing Kucinich would be the only step in this direction. If he's not on the ballot, I'm not wasting my vote on any other candidate. The rest are mere corporate shills. If he does get elected by some miracle and turns out to be a disappointment, that will be it. Maybe that's exactly why people are afraid to believe Kucinich has a chance?
