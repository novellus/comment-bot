In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now.\n\n&gt;After I remove the icepack, I use a deep \npore-cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a \nwater-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub.\n\n&gt;Then I apply an herb mint facial masque which I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine.\n\n&gt;I always use an after-shave lotion with little or no alcohol because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye \nbalm, followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.\n\n&gt;There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some \nkind of abstraction, hut there is no real me, only an entity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping you \nand maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable: I simply am not there.\n\n", "author": "feanor512", "created_utc": "1192482588", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "ups": 0, "parent_id": "t3_5yczb", "id": "c029d0p", "author_flair_css_class": null}
