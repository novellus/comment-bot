Hopefully the true Paul campaign can get up there and kick inordinate amounts of ass, and pick it up. I know many are cynical of the idea of RP doing anything in real life (after all, his group of supporters is the lowest voting group) but I think he could pull of some Jimmy Carter style shit.\n\nAlso, I know there are a lot of Ron Paul haters, but I must ask, while I agree no politician deserves a \"don't recieve criticism\" card, do you feel the other republican candidates are better? \n", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5yf7q", "id": "c029if3", "author_flair_css_class": null}
