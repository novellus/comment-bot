Which holds for your condemnation of Iran as well.\n\nYes, Iran's government is not perfect. Perhaps that has something to do with good old Uncle Sam [overthrowing their democracy in 1953](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) and [replacing it with a dictatorship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Reza_Pahlavi#Westernization_and_autocracy). Which they did manage to bring down after a couple of decades (with no \"help\" from US) and now they're [moving again in a democratic direction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majlis_of_Iran#Islamic_Republic_-_Islamic_Consultative_Assembly).\n\nYes, they're not perfect, and they still haven't managed to reverse all the harm that was done to their democratic process in 1953. But, while you can talk about Iran all you want, *condemning* them makes you no more than a self-righteous hypocrite, unless you are one of these:\n\n1. An Iranian national.\n2. A well-informed citizen of a country with a democratic and human rights record clearly and vastly superior to that of Iran (of which there are perhaps just a handful, and US not among them).\nor\n3. An expert on Iran, having spent years studying the country and having visited it extensively.\n\nUnless you are one of these, your attitude is not merely self-righteous and hypocritical, but straight out dangerous at a time when it helps and reinforces Cheney's war propaganda.", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "ups": 1, "name": "t1_c02buu7", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5z957", "retrieved_on": 1427425126, "score_hidden": false, "body": "  &gt;Oh yes, I see now.

Now I will; you are intellectually immature and do not understand the basics of logical discourse and argumentation.\n\n&gt;As for my argument, it has been consistent all along. Do not hold a foreign government, immersed in a culture that you do not know, engaged in acts that can only be understood with very careful study, to standards of accountability stricter than those obeyed by your own government.\n\nYeah, I got that the first time and I still categorically disagree.  It's bullshit.  I don't have to be perfect to decry bad behavior in others.  Nobody does, and it's a good thing too, because nobody is perfect.\n\n&gt;In fact, the sheer remoteness and lack of cultural context require very solid evidence, and a very serious violation, before making any such condemnation.

Genocide isn't something that happens overnight; it starts with little things and slowly escalates over time.  Finally, it's not about Iran allegedly shutting down coffee shops.

Do I support war with Iran?  Did I say anything at all about it or are you jumping to conclusions based on your own prejudices?  For the record I think war with Iran would be disastrous and I never supported the war in Iraq.  You don't see that because you are a clone and are not used to people thinking independently of a slate of preconceived notions that you think are your own, but that have actually been thrust upon you by society at large.  \n\nA final note; if I were you I wouldn't get too fired up over a potential war with Iran.
