This is a reasonable question. It is indeed a complex system when you consider its interactions as a whole. (I repost to attempt to clarify my explanation).\n\nIt is not easy to explain in a short space such detail. To explain it would be an entire study in sound economic principles at a very thorough level, which I surely don't have anywhere near absolute thorough knowledge. I still study it.\n\nIn a 9:1 fractional reserve system...\n\nFirstly by law, the bank cannot just go and make money when it feels like it. It must be on demand from its customers to take a loan. So the bank tries to encourage demand by encouraging customers to take out a loan. But it's customers may not want a loan - they may have savings etc. So the banks are naturally limited by demand.\n\nInflation also affects demand for loans.\n\nDemand can be controlled by lowering or highering the interest rate which is the controllable rate that the borrower must pay back on top of the loan.\n\nWhen you do go and borrow $10K (not withdraw your own deposits if you have any), $9K is issued as new (and may be issued as new cash from the Federal Mint if necessary) and $1K comes from existing held money by the bank. You may take out the loan over say 10 years, so effects on inflation of the creation of that loan would be spread over the 10 years of payback (if you consider as a simplification that that 'person' is going to take one $10K loan every 10 years and pay each loan back gradually over that each 10 year period).\n\nIf under the same Fractional Reserve banking rules, if a body borrows $1B as debt, then 9/10 of that would be issued as new money ($900M), while 1/10 ($100M) would be taken out of existing money. When spent into the economy, this would cause inflationary pressure, but at the same time as new money is being put into the economy, lent money is being collected by repayment of earlier loans over a longer period of 5, 10, 20 years or more. So the Inflationary rate is spread across the repayment if a single one off loan was made. (almost right).\n\nThe recollection of the loan may result in some money being removed from the local economy of commonly traded goods by the large banks that then put this money into assets like the purchase of shares which push up share price, but because the money is not traded between the majority of people in the local economy for everyday items, the money which is removed reduces the inflationary pressures.\n\nFor example, consider this. If there is $10T ($10,000B) in existence in this world - say 1/10 in the US and 9/10 outside of the US. In that year if $2T is borrowed worldwide (by US government, various corporations and individuals) and is borrowed at the same rate in preceding years and the following years. That may be considered a 20% inflation, but, things are not so simple. Money is also being repaid at a rate, and is being removed from the local economy of commonly traded goods into shares, pushing the share prices generally upwards. So the inflationary pressure on commonly traded goods in the local market is less, and yet wealth is steadily being transferred from those holding US Dollars into the newly printed money. Furthermore, efficiency of production is also continually being increased and is having a countering effect on the inflationary pressure, so again less inflation is experienced than this 20%. But the efficiency of production depends on the product, computer system are continually becoming easier to produce (more output per capita or per manpower) at a phenomenal rate while houses are becoming easier to produce at a much slower rate. But inflationary pressure is greater than the rate at which houses are becoming cheaper to produce, so they appear to be going up in cost.\n\nZimbabwe I would expect (as a guess) is freely printing new money, and not bothering to recollect through tax, which the banks then largely do not put into any stock market or other non-locally experienced economies.\n\nI hope I can help you to understand. It surely takes a lot of thinking and is a complex chaotic system as a whole.

This is when the money is created.  Someone promised to pay back the $10K, so the fed creates it, based on their promise.  With the fractional reserve issue, this means $100K of 'cash' is added to our system.  This is weird.  If our country borrows $1B, we actually created $10B in 'cash'? (credit, whatever)\n\nThis would mean that even if you go by the idea that at least the money created as debt means somewhere, people are putting assets up to back the loan (usually), there is 10 times the money being 'created' as there is assets.  \n\nWhy isnt our inflation similar to Zimbabwe's then?  It doesnt make sense. We do have inflation, but it seems like it should be much higher if this is how it works.  \n\nThe whole thing is confusing.

The US Federal Reserve with the system of private banks control who gets these newly issued Fiat Dollars and how much they get.  - Money, power, and control.\n\nWhen new money is printed, the wealth of the world is divided between a larger number of existing dollars.  So the actual worth of each dollar becomes less, and a portion of wealth is transfered from all those who are holding the US Fiat Dollar to the US Federal Mint and the primary beneficiaries of this newly printed money.\n\nIf half as many people will be using the Federal Reserve's Fiat Dollar, then the Federal Reserve system and its private banks cannot get away with printing the same amount of money \"out of thin air\" to lend as debt on demand. - The result would be double the inflationary pressure (devaluing of each fiat dollar) after the new money is spent into the economy as debt.\n\nFor anyone curious or wants to know more about where money comes from, here are some interesting documentaries on how the Federal Reserve (or another country's Central Bank) prints new money on demand for the Private Banks which lends it out as debt:\n\n(0) http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9050474362583451279 (45m) - Money As Debt\n\n(1) http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-466210540567002553 (40m) - Money, Banking and the Federal Reserve\n\n(2) http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5232639329002339531 (1h) - Fiat Empire\n ", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": -3, "author": "majorneo", "created_utc": "1193404545", "children": [{"subreddit": "politics", "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": -1, "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": "1193407311", "children": [{"controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "politics", "created_utc": "1193420022", "name": "t1_c02bidm", "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5z5fc", "retrieved_on": 1427425288, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02bidm", "author": "majorneo", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_c02bgti", "body": "You got that right", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "ups": -1, "name": "t1_c02bgti", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5z5fc", "retrieved_on": 1427425308, "score_hidden": false, "body": "Nope nobody in the region can have nuclear weapons except the UN declared terrorist state of Israel, nope no one.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c02bgja", "id": "c02bgti", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "politics", "score_hidden": false, "ups": -3, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_5z5fc", "retrieved_on": 1427425312, "id": "c02bgja", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02bgja", "parent_id": "t1_c02bg6w", "body": "Well I'm sure Oil price stability and US dollar usage play a part however you must admit that Syria didn't exactly make everyone really comfortable by trying to build what appears to be a secret nuclear program.
