Gluon allows you to use any ORM of your choice, including SQLAlchemy, althought automatic generation of forms and the database administrative interface will not work. The Gluon components are not really separate blocks as they are in TG because they are supposed to work together more.

Those are noble goals you have. I think, since those are the real goals, you should promote Gluon based on them rather than based on the feature set which is pretty standard.\n\nDjango and TG are pretty lame. If you were about to embark on creating Gluon I'd suggest checking out Pylons. But you already have Gluon so there's probably no point.\n\nI think (and I'm not sure, others may have made this point more cogently elsewhere) that using anything other than SQLAlchemy is a serious mistake. Well, anything else for SQL access. The benefits are ridiculous.\n\nAs for templating, Python doesn't really have a good one, and suffers from having a variety that are all worse than PHP. Yours probably has compelling benefits to you and grad students learning web dev. I would be more explicit about the design choices I made so others can appreciate your reasoning, which is probably sound, but wasn't really clear at the website.\n\nGood luck with your project. :)", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t1_c029ot3", "id": "c02acah", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "programming", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 1, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "link_id": "t3_2wpx9", "retrieved_on": 1427426208, "id": "c029ot3", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c029ot3", "parent_id": "t1_c2x08h", "body": "I did it for fun, mostly to kill time on a plane, and I love it.
