Are all dog breeds equally smart?  No.  Equally strong?  No.  Fast?  No.  There is a *huge* amount of variety that separates one breed from another.\n\nWhy is everyone so resolutely, arbitrarily declaring that evolution applies to animals, but not humans?  If animal breeds/\"races\" have evolved differently in separate geographical regions, why wouldn't humans?\n\nTake a simple example.  Taller people can run faster, swim faster.  As a population, on average, if you're taller, you're faster.\n\nNow are you going to tell me that every human \"race\", from Africans to Indians to Pygmies and Aborigines has exactly the same mean height?  I don't think so.  Ergo, different human populations will have different maximum running speeds.  Is that offensive?\n\nI think I have to agree with the scientist.  All the hoping in the world will not make it true.  We should stop ignoring *science* in some area because the results might offend us.\n\nI'm no racist -- I'm not claiming any individual should be judged on the basis of their \"group\".  This is, at the very least, because individual variation is **huge**.  And there is no \"natural\" definition of race, of course.  But that doesn't stop someone from arbitrarily creating some groups and reasoning about their properties, just like one reasons about \"Metals\" and \"Noble Gases\" in the periodic table of elements.\n\nIf your DNA is X% consistent with this South African area known for long distance running,  and just *maybe* it's reasonable to assume there has been some evolutionary pressure to make individuals, on average, faster at running than most others in the world, then we can conclude this individual is Z% likely to be faster than an Eskimo whose culture never runs fast or far because they live on ice and fish, and their evolutionary pressure has been about storing heat and fat.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
