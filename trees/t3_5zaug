One of the big problems with having bad RAM or a bad CPU especially is that there is a gamut of problems you can run into.

I've seen cases where a bad stick of ram causes problems because it passes the POST, but when the OS tries to load, it fails, or boots up but fails randomly (presumably because the data it's putting into RAM is coming out corrupted).  Because of that, bad RAM can sometimes have the same symptoms as a HD with bad sectors, an overheating problem, flaky motherboard, or even just normal Windows instability.  Further more, the guys recommending the new mobo might not have been far off either.  There are a lot of old systems floating out there where the cost of new RAM would be more than the cost of a new mobo+cpu+ram bundle.
