About 10 years ago I began a job as a computer consultant for a consulting firm in the midwest.  A lot of our customers were in the RV manufacturing business and or companies that supported the RV manufacturing business.  \nIn the very beginning of my job there 90% of the employees in those companies were white.    Towards the end of my time at that consulting firm 90% of the employees were Mexican.\nNow the story you hear on the news is \"they do the jobs most Americans don't want to do.\"   Which is bullshit.  The jobs in these factories were skilled labor, good benefits and good pay.  \nThat was until the owners figured out they could replace those employees with low paid workers who got little to no benefits.", "author_flair_css_class": null}

There is only one exception to this requirement: If an applicant has served in the U.S. armed forces during war, that person may be naturalized without first becoming a permanent resident if they were in the U.S. upon induction or enlistment into our military.\n\nContinuous residence in the U.S. for at least five years immediately preceding the applicant's filing for naturalization. Continuous residence is not the same thing as physically present here. That is, one must maintain their status as a \"legal permanent resident\" but not necessarily be physically inside the borders of the U.S. to accomplish that. For example, if one is overseas for a portion of this period, maintaining an address location and paying one's state and federal taxes may help ensure continuity of residence for this requirement. Also, if overseas for anymore than a few months, it may be advisable to obtain a \"travel document\" prior to departing. This may be done on INS Form I-131. Only three years \"continuous residence\" are required if the applicant is filing for naturalization based upon marriage.\n\nActual physical residence (within the state in which the petition is filed) during at least the three months immediately before filing for naturalization is another requirement.\n\nPhysical presence within the U.S. for a total of at least one half of the period of required continuous residence. That is, two and a half years for most applicants and one and a half years for spouses of U.S. Citizens.\n\nThe ability to read, write and speak ordinary English unless they are physically unable to do so due to a disability such as being blind or deaf, or suffer from a developmental disability or mental impairment. Those over 50 years old on the date of filing who have lived here for a total of at least 20 years after admission as a permanent resident and those who are over 55 and have been legal permanent residents for at least 15 years are also exempt from this requirement.\n\nA basic understanding the fundamentals of U.S. history and government.\n\nGood moral character and an affinity for the principles of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nContinuous residence (but not necessarily physical presence) in the U.S. from the date of filing the naturalization application up to the date of being sworn in as a citizen.\n\nApplicants should be at least 18 years of age at the time of filing.
