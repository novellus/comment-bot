However, according to recent studies, California chaparral is extraordinarily resilient to very long periods without fire (Keeley, J.E., A.H. Pfaff, and H.D. Safford 2005) and continues to maintain productive growth throughout pre-fire conditions (Hubbard 1986, Larigauderie et al. 1990). Seeds of many chaparral plants actually require 30 years or more worth of accumulated leaf litter before they will successfully germinate (e.g. scrub oak: Quercus berberidifolia, toyon: Heteromeles arbutifolia, holly-leafed cherry: Prunus ilicifolia). When intervals between fires drop below 10 to 15 years, many chaparral species are eliminated and the system is typically replaced by non-native, weedy grassland (Haidinger and Keeley 1993, Keeley 1995, Zedler 1995).\r\n\r\n&gt; The idea that older chaparral is responsible for causing large fires was originally proposed in the 1980\u2019s by comparing wildfires in Baja California and southern California. It was suggested that fire suppression activities in southern California allowed more fuel to accumulate which in turn led to larger fires (in Baja, fires often burn without active suppression efforts). This is similar to the argument that fire suppression in western United States has allowed Ponderosa Pine forests to become \u201coverstocked.\u201d In the past, surface-fires burned through these forests at intervals of anywhere between 4 and 36 years, clearing out the understory and creating a more ecologically balanced system. However, chaparral has a crown-fire regime, meaning fires consume the entire system whenever they burn. Detailed analysis of historical fire data has shown that fire suppression activities have failed to exclude fire from southern California chaparral as they have in Ponderosa Pine forests (Keeley et al. 1999). In addition, the number of fires is increasing in step with population growth. Overall, chaparral stand age does not have a significant correlation to its tendency to burn (Moritz et al. 2004). Low humidity, low fuel moisture, and high winds appear to be the primary factors in determining when a chaparral stand burns.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaparral ", "author": "grauenwolf", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "archived": true, "subreddit": "science", "name": "t1_c02bomg", "parent_id": "t1_c02bnqe", "score_hidden": false, "id": "c02bomg"}], "subreddit": "science", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c02bnqe", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 5, "link_id": "t3_5z8rr", "retrieved_on": 1427425218, "body": "Simple answer, yes.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5z8rr", "id": "c02bnqe", "author_flair_css_class": null}
