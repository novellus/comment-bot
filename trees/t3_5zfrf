I don't know where this guy gets the idea that most mathematicians are Platonists. It seems to me that Platonism mostly died out sometime a little after the turn of the previous century. It lives on in highschool education, but amongst actual mathematicians, at least, the ones that I know, it's mostly a dead idea. (Maybe it's just the school I came from?)\n\nIt's okay to say that for all x, x = 0 or x /= 0. Even though we might not necessarily know how to decide which, and even though it may indeed be undecidable for certain definitions of x, our logical rules grant us the ability to say that P or not P is unconditionally true. In fact, you need not even turn the universally quantified statement into a number.\n\nThis is something which is formally granted to us by the rules that we decided on. If we want, we can change those rules of course. We usually choose not to, for the benefit of being able to easily communicate with one another. There are enough interesting problems in the mathematics we already have that most people don't feel so tempted to start a whole new one. Still, there is no illusion about the essential arbitrariness of the axioms we choose.\n\nOf course, if using different axioms would be more convenient for the physicists, perhaps there'd be some pressure to switch things around to get funding, but largely the choices mathematicians make about axioms are based on their own sense of the beauty or interestingness of the resulting systems.\n\nNot to mention that physics has lots of arbitrariness in it too. How we choose to model our observations is a decision which we make consciously. It's not set in stone tablets handed down from some deity. Isn't that kind of the whole point of the scientific method?\n\nMathematics and science are of *course* human inventions, perhaps some of the most elaborate and successful human inventions ever. I personally find the notion that it's all somehow \"out there\" in the aether for us to stumble on seems a bit insulting to all those who constructed it. Then again, perhaps they can take it as a compliment -- their design decisions were good enough to fool people into thinking that their system was not arbitrary.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
