Well that makes sense. As I said in my original comment I'm really not versed in all the relations between copyright/licensing/etc.\n\nThanks.\n\nBut it still makes me wonder. Infact, if you look at the site at the very bottom is a Q/A section that says, in effect, \"if you dont like the license just relicense it under some other license you like\"... So I don't know, maybe the addendum is unnecessary but in this case it looks like they're explicitly allowing you to change the license...
