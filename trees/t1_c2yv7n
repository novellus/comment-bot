The Congress of the United States is forbidding from abridging freedom of speech or religion--the legislatures of the states can do whatever they want, under the terms of their own state constitutions (some or all support freedom of speech, religion, arms-bearing and so forth).  If the US Constitution doesn't forbid it, and the state constitution allows it, then the state can do it; the individual states are sovereigns after all.\n\nThe state supreme courts may have powers of review, and may be able to quell un(state)constitutional laws.\n\nI'd like to take it even further and give counties even more latitude than states, and cities more than counties, and neighbourhoods more than cities.
