It fills the gaps by giving no answer.  By saying \"God\" created the first cells is giving no answer at all.  That is the equivalent of secularists saying we don't know what created the first living organisms.  No one knows what God is or what created God so they are at the same starting point again while throwing in a lot of mindless mumbo jumbo about a God.  And saying God exists outside the realm of the natural world explains nothing because where does this realm that God exists in come from?  Everything must have a beginning, or does it not?  We don't know but saying God did it is just an easy answer to a question you can't answer.
