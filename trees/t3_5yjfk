I know what you mean with the Radiohead issue thoguh. I'm not a fan, nor will I buy their music but what they are doing is a great example to not only other artists, but a lot of other people in the entertainment industry.  This way people can support the music they like, so the artists will be inclinded to release more of it, without given profits to record companies.
