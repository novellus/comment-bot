I suspect the model can be used to sustain any band big enough to have even a moderate fan following.  I know the UK band Marillion has financed its last couple albums by pre-selling CDs *before even going into the studio.*  The number of pre-sales they made determined how much they could spend producing the album, and they were guaranteed to at least break even. (assuming not a single CD is sold besides the preorders, which is effectively an impossibility) Reportedly they're doing quite well at this.\r\n\r\nThe REAL question is whether the \"pay what you want\" model will work with bands that don't have an established following.  And I don't see how we can find that out without some brave people following in Radiohead's footsteps (*god, I can't believe I said that*) and trying it for themselves.
