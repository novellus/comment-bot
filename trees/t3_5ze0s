Would it have been unprofessional to suggest how convenient it was for an agency under the State Department to investigate an incident which could potentially embarrass the State Department, being that Blackwater\u2019s contract is with the State Department? \nBlackwater\u2019s CEO and his wives have donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Republican candidates and political action groups.  His foundation and his mother\u2019s foundation (of which he is VP) have together given over $6 million to conservative think tanks and other conservative organizations.  Just do a web search for \u201cBlackwater Bush/Republican ties.\u201d\nI apologize for such a long comment, but I wish more people would realize the ridiculousness of the issue.  What could possibly serve as a politically neutral, legitimate reason for the State Department\u2019s secrecy?\n\nWhat does Bush\u2019s State Department gain from hiding Blackwater\u2019s guilt?\n\n-avoiding political embarrassment, exposing damaging corruption, losing campaign and think tank contributions\n\nWhat does the Department gain from hiding Blackwater\u2019s innocence?\n\n-someone help me out here\u2026\n\nTo me, why the Diplomatic Security investigators gave immunity is pretty clear.\n", "author_flair_css_class": null}
