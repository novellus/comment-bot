It is a very interesting phenomenon. From the article:\n\n&gt; Terra preta, Woods guesses, covers at least 10 percent of Amazonia, an area the size of France. It has amazing properties, he says. Tropical rain doesn't leach nutrients from terra preta fields; instead the soil, so to speak, fights back. Not far from Painted Rock Cave is a 300-acre area with a two-foot layer of terra preta quarried by locals for potting soil. The bottom third of the layer is never removed, workers there explain, because over time it will re-create the original soil layer in its initial thickness. The reason, scientists suspect, is that terra preta is generated by a special suite of microorganisms that resists depletion. \"Apparently,\" Woods and the Wisconsin geographer Joseph M. McCann argued in a presentation last summer, \"at some threshold level ... dark earth attains the capacity to perpetuate\u2014even regenerate itself\u2014thus behaving more like a living 'super'-organism than an inert material.\"\n\nThere is a [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_preta) on the subject with a good collection of links if you are interested.", "subreddit": "science", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5zgdh", "name": "t1_c02cc74", "author_flair_css_class": null}
