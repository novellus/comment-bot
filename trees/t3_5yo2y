Producers are already required by law to keep VERY detailed records on the actors and proof of age verification, date of filming, etc. I don't see anything really changing, other then the law taking note of a new format that it should have been policing, anyway. \n\nLittle known extension of the law - If you rip off an image or video from a legitimite pron company who has valid age documentation and then host it as your own, you become responsible for age verification, not the company you ripped off from. Think they'd be likely to help you to supply the age verification?\n\nThe #1 impact this would have on YouPron is that there could be some VERY difficult legal positions for people who rip off other companies stuff (not to mention the pre-existing one: copyright law)\n\nAnd that boils down to the main problem with YouPron: Most of the content, and especially the \"quality\" content, isn't john and janes home video, its ripped dvds or movie files. I'm an addict, i've seen LOTS of film, and I see a lot of familiar faces on so called \"user-submitted\" sites. \n\nDon't like copyright law? Ok, no prob, I'm with you, though I have FAR more respect for \"the industry\" then the RIAA. But theres another purpose for this law, and one I think most people can agree on: children in pron.
