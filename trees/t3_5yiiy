Personally, I love watching the 15-20 minutes of previews before a movie. I think a lot of people do. In fact, I get pissed off if I'm late and I miss them. Why? Because trailers are entertaining. I *like* seeing what other movies are coming out, and the trailer shows me what the movie is like in a few minutes which is usually long enough to get me interested.\n\nI also enjoy 'clever' ads in other media. And mind you, I wouldn't go out of my way to look at these things. I wouldn't sit at home and watch an hour of previews, and I wouldn't look up a bunch of interesting ads online just for entertainment. But I do occasionally download a trailer, and the fact that trailers are available online and there are TV shows of nothing but \"cool commercials\" seems to indicate that I'm not just crazy. \n\nMy original point, which you seem to have missed, is that advertising is an art form. (Not high art, but art.) It takes some real talent to produce something people will see and *like*, even though it was completely unsolicited. It's not effective to just bombard people with ads, which is what web advertising seems to be. The idea is to make the person you're soliciting actually *like* your product (be it a movie, TV show, whatever). So that's what I mean when I say they did something wrong. They did such a terrible job of trying to get people to like their product that people are actually *dis*liking their product.\n\nAnyway, this doesn't have a lot of relevance to the article, so I'll stop.
