Like rape is a word used everyday but fuck is obscene, even though it's the same activity with force and violence rather than joy.  So it's the joy that is really the outrage there.  I mean, how do you explain rape to a child any better than fuck?  Violence makes anything acceptable, so bloody gorefests like Saw are acceptable movie fare, but OMGZ you put too long of a nude scene of OMG *making love* in your movie?  XXX!!
