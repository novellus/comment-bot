Thus overpopulation cannot be the real issue as it is a function of something else. It must be based on the largest growth factor of those variables. The only one that has been consistently rising for the past 10,000 years is food production.\n\nWe simply have too much food which, by the Lotka-Volterra equations, causes us to have a population size that is hitting carrying capacity limits. To clamp down the birthrate to meet this food excess we would have to institute worldwide birth control and generate about 25 TW of power (as birthrate is an allometric function of energy use per capita). That just doesn't seem very possible absent nuclear fission or fusion power.\n\nOverpopulation has a textbook result in all species studied thus far, namely dieoff. If we wish to avoid this fate, we'll have to get a lot smarter on how we set up energy use and food production on this planet.", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "name": "t1_c02b87y", "parent_id": "t3_5z2xu", "id": "c02b87y", "author_flair_css_class": null}
