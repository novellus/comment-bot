That would force whoever wants to bring the bill up to use the actual rules -- typically making a \"motion to proceed\" -- which is a bit of a pain in the ass, and requires getting an actual vote on whether or not to start debate on this bill.\n\n&gt; If you're really insistent, you'll show up and filibuster the motion to proceed. Then we're back in the familiar and annoying territory of needing 60 votes to do anything. And that's always dicey, especially in an atmosphere in which Senators will automatically get each others' backs even if they're doing something stupid, like filibustering a motion to proceed on a perfectly good and popular bill. You get another Senator's back on something stupid, because one day you'll need him to get yours on something equally stupid.\n\n&gt; So what it comes down to is that the \"hold\" is simply a matter of \"professional courtesy.\" I want a bill held, so I notify my party leader of my intention to object to any unanimous consent request to bring the bill to the floor. Implied in that is the hint that I will make everyone sorry they brought it up if they don't just give me what I want, and they know by now that any Senator can do that, so they might as well just go ahead and hold it, for the sake of everyone's sanity.\n\nThe Senate is intentionally designed to protect not only the minority party, but the minority position on any issue and to require compromise toward consensus.\n\nIt's designed to be a conservative force, resisting ill-advised transient hysterias.\n\n  ", "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit": "politics", "ups": 2, "name": "t1_c029zbw", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5ylzy", "retrieved_on": 1427426072, "score_hidden": false, "body": "My knowledge of Senate procedings gets fuzzy at this point.
