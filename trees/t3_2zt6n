Lots of people have opinions, many of them are professional scientists, some of them are very, very good professional scientists (Freeman Dyson, for example.)\n\nNow, a 90% confidence interval is enough to change policy, and certainly enough to start preparing for big changes. If we were 90% certain of earth being hit by an asteroid, we'd start pushing to get the damn thing out of the way.\n\nBut 90% certain is not enough certain enough to still discourse or mock people for their views in a scientific context. And people outside of the IPCC clearly have much, much different estimates on the real probability that we are changing the climate.\n\nMy own feeling is that we're going to find out that underlying cycles are doing most of the work of warming, but that we're making one of those cycles worse, and that biome loss is a further destabilizer.
