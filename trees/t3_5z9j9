Hence all of the Jesus parables about the tax collector being more righteous than the Jewish holy men, the lashing out at the money changers in the temple, and ultimately his death penalty.\n\nWell, 2000 years have passed, and nothing has changed - especially in the Catholic church that I go to.  Today they had a sermon about the sorry tax collector and the more righteous than thou Jewish holy man.  As they were talking, I couldn't but to help think about the astounding hypocrisy.  In 30 years of going to church, have they ever criticized our fiat money system and all the inflation and debt it creates?  Between sales, state, property, income, and a bunch of other oddball taxes I could pay up to 50% of everything I make to the government.  Has the Catholic church ever stood up for me?  **Never.**  Why?  Well because that would be \"political\" speech and they would no longer be treated as a tax exempt organization.  \n\nSo basically, most religions in the US Empire are selling us out for tax exempt status just like the Phrases sold out Jesus and had him murdered 2000 years ago to keep their status under the Roman Empire. \n\nDon't ask me why I go.
