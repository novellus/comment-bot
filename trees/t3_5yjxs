Well, duh.  Most of them can barely type.\n\nReality check (I have taught CS at universities).  Think of CS like it were art school.  All there is time for is to give the students a class in crayons, a class in charcoal, a class in oils, and with a little luck, a quick art appreciation class that sort of hints at the progression of his craft.  There is no time (or need) for great depth.  The goal is to make him aware of useful avenues to explore when seeking solutions to new problems.  He will have mastered nothing.  At graduation, this kid hasn't done a single non-trivial program (or maybe one - but likely not more).  At best he can draw kind of well in one medium.  This guy seems to expect that the new grad is capable of master's level work?  That takes time and practice and (dare I say it?) experience and maturity.\n\nFrom the point of the Uni, there is no point in teaching the hot thing.  It will change faster than the university can figure out what it is.  The best developers know at least 4 languages well, and have had casual exposure to another dozen.  At this point, a new language can be picked up in about a month.  Switching languages is easy when you have a broad base to work from.  The programs the experienced developer writes in all languages will be powerful as they will mix and match the best idioms from the various forms.  More tools, more colors, more tricks in the bag.  This is the point in his career when he is capable of having vision and making profound contributions.  \n\nA new grad simply lacks both the depth and breadth of experience to do this and it is unreasonable to expect it.  Perhaps Mr Startup should get a little funding and find a guy who knows a few things and pay him to solve these pressing problems.", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5yjxs", "id": "c029tci", "author_flair_css_class": null}
