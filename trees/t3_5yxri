Take an unpopular law that the society will not accept and you don't get compliance with the law. What you get instead is those that see the law as ineffective and must associate with criminals whom they normally would not do so in any other circumstances. So we are making more prisoners by association. \n\nThe three stikes out is also contributing to the overcrowding of prisons. For just having attracted the attention of the law, you could be put in prison even though your crime may not be serious. \n\nThe Drug War is failed policy that no one in local police forces wants to give up the money funding it as funds are short all the way around. It is far easier to take the money than to look locally for increases in funding with the lack of funds already felt by politicians trying to come up with ways to creatively fund more pork barrels. \n\nWe seem to have no say anymore in government.
