It sounds like something that will generate ever more new requirements and never be delivered.\n\nRather, you should focus internal dev resources on small-scale patching of the integration holes you will inevitably get between all those consumer/small biz/specialized apps.\n\nIf you go down this road, you will NOT get a \"clean\" application portfolio. You will get MS Excel hacks, MS Access kludges, scripting band-aids, manual work-arounds etc. etc. But guess what? All reasonably sized companies get those anyway, and most of them get them ON TOP OF a big enterprise software cost sinkhole.\n\nMy advice is to avoid paying ridiculous amounts of money for shitty software (and I've yet to encounter enterprise software that isn't shitty) at all costs, even if you will have to live with the less-than-perfect consequences.\n\n(Disclaimer: I'm no expert, but I've both worked for an enterprise software vendor, and for a big enterprise (tens of thousands of employees) which buys enterprise software suites.)", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1427425007, "subreddit_id": "t5_2fwo", "created_utc": "1193725166", "ups": 3, "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5zcj1", "downs": 0, "score": 3, "id": "c02c422", "author": "[deleted]", "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "body": "Why will you be *consuming* Enterprise software?\n\nAre you suicidal or something?
