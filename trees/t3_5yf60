He is the only man on daytime TV who can get angry and not alienate his female audience.  If anything, it endears him to his audience.  Maybe it's his bald head, or the fact that he's black, or both.  I don't know.  I guess it's just his stage presence.  But he can get angry and maintain the sympathy of women voters.  I can't think of a single other man on TV who could do that.  The rest of them who are well liked by a female audience have more of a pandering personality.  Dr. Phil, Donaghue, and so on.  Well, one more exception would be that guy with the judge show who isn't really a judge.  I can't remember his name, which is my point.  He doesn't have the stage presence.\n\nThis talk about daytime talk show hosts sounds pretty ridiculous on the face of it, but this I believe that is actually how public policy is shaped.  I'll give you an example.  Michael J. Fox did a commercial in which he didn't suppress his tremors like he usually does.  He railed against the Republicans in Congress who were blocking stem cell research that could develop treatments for degenerative nerve diseases like his.  The GOP threw a fit, and genuinely got scared. They got scared because the people at home asked themselves, hey, that's that Republican guy that was on that show in the '80s.  He's like Reagan.  I like him.  So he is mad at the other Republicans?  What did they do?  He's all shaky and they won't let him have his medicine?  That's terrible!\n\nThe fact that Fox is a Canadian citizen and only played a Republican on TV, but was never formerly involved in politics doesn't matter.  He was able to exploit people's ignorance to advance his cause.  And advance it he did.\n\nAll the well reasoned arguments in the world wouldn't hold a candle to the change we could push through if Montel Williams had a teenage girl on his show who broke down in tears after describing her father's suicide when his ex-wife raised his child support to higher than his take-home pay and he was about to go to jail.  And then Montel comforts the girl, faces the camera, and makes his angry face.", "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "reddit.com", "name": "t1_c029op1", "parent_id": "t1_c029lby", "ups": 2, "author_flair_css_class": null}], "subreddit_id": "t5_6", "name": "t1_c029lby", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 2, "link_id": "t3_5yf60", "retrieved_on": 1427426254, "body": " Point well taken.

And once Montel Had Spoken, our senators took notice and passed some reforms.\n\nI think it's high time the same thing was done to the DHS.  These agencies whose budget and power is based on their ability to squeeze citizens just clamp down harder every year until the governing body that empowers them steps in and corrects it.  It's a cyclic beaurocratic process.\n\nSince the brunt of this is suffered by non-custodial fathers, it's hard to get the Congress to get that excited.
