Right now they are offering computers. EResarchGroup and SurveyRewards are both rip off web sites. I contacted www.SurveyRewards.com on Saturday Oct. 20/07 and at the bottom of the page there is an unsubscribe link. Just click on the link and a new page will open and you will be able to unsubscribe. The second way to do it is to type: www.purelyunsub.com and you can unsubscribe from their e-mails. I don't know about E-researchgoup as I have not received any e-mails from them.\r\n\r\nSurvey Research gave my name, address and telphone number to a voice mail company that I never subscribed to. I called their 800 nuber and had the charges removed and told them to close my account, as I did not open one with them. The name of the company is PBA VMAILMT. I cannot find them on the web. I called their 800 number and got their mailing address, and then filed a Ripoff Report.", "author": "SRobert", "created_utc": "1192922012", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "business", "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5yrar", "id": "c02abdk", "author_flair_css_class": null}
