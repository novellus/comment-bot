First, because of their rings color (light blue) which fits perfectly on my silver car. Second, because they're a single unit headlights with a corner. I hate the 2 part headlights. The problem is that my headlights are getting old and they always look dirty even after washing the car. So, I was thinking of replacing them and while I'm looking for some alternatives, I have found some great headlights that I didn't even know they exist.", "author_flair_css_class": null}
